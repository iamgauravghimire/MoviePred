0,m/1000013-12_angry_men,James Kendrick,Fresh,2011-12-02,an incisive and gripping film
1,m/1000013-12_angry_men,Dan Jardine,Fresh,2009-08-03,"taut, well-crafted sociological study"
2,m/1000013-12_angry_men,Matthew Pejkovic,Fresh,2010-07-06,A brilliant courtroom drama whose strength lies within the power of Rose's words and Sidney Lumet's great direction (his debut).
3,m/1000013-12_angry_men,Ian Nathan,Fresh,2001-04-17,"Thoroughly engaging, there is nothing dated or corny in Reginald Rose's intensely knowing screenplay and Lumet's energetic direction."
4,m/1000013-12_angry_men,Nick Davis,Fresh,2009-12-28,"12 Angry Men has some shrewd observations to sell about argumentation and group behavior, but they're not the ones of which the film seems most proud."
5,m/1000013-12_angry_men,John A. Nesbit,Fresh,2002-04-05,"12 Angry Men ranks as the tautest courtroom drama you'll ever see, surpassing Lumet's very good 1982 drama, The Verdict."
6,m/1000013-12_angry_men,Brian Webster,Fresh,2001-04-18,"While the composition of juries might change over time, the issues and attitudes that are explored here are timeless, as is this classic film."
7,m/1000013-12_angry_men,Christopher Machell,Fresh,2017-05-26,"In the 60 years since its release, Sidney Lumet's masterpiece has lost none of its impact. In this age of unreason, 12 Angry Men remains sorely and urgently contemporary."
8,m/1000013-12_angry_men,Eric Melin,Fresh,2011-12-09,"This was Sidney Lumet's first movie and it's as riveting as it was back in the late 50s, when everything was changing."
9,m/1000013-12_angry_men,Tim Dirks,Fresh,2002-04-05,"12 Angry Men (1957) is the gripping, penetrating, and engrossing examination of a diverse group of twelve jurors - all male, mostly middle-aged, white, and"
10,m/1000013-12_angry_men,Urban Cinefile Critics,Fresh,2000-01-01,"A film with texture, humour and relevance at all times. All in 91 minutes."
11,m/1000013-12_angry_men,Richard Propes,Fresh,2020-09-24,Reginald Rose's script is one of deep revelation.
12,m/1000013-12_angry_men,Dragan Antulov,Fresh,2000-01-01,Completely deserved its high status of undisputed classic.
13,m/1000013-12_angry_men,Variety Staff,Fresh,2008-06-30,The film leaves a tremendous impact.
14,m/1000013-12_angry_men,Mike Massie,Fresh,2020-08-15,"Thought-provoking, continually riveting, and absolutely unforgettable - and surprisingly designed around a very simple, tightly budgeted, special-effects-free premise."
15,m/1000013-12_angry_men,M. Faust,Fresh,2011-01-02,Outstanding Henry Fonda jury classic.
16,m/1000013-12_angry_men,Rob Humanick,Fresh,2007-07-03,"Makes no self-saluting motions to greater importance, which gives the material the much-desired breathing room it needs to reach full potency."
17,m/1000013-12_angry_men,Ian Mantgani,Fresh,2003-01-10,"An intense concentration of power, and my all-time favourite film."
18,m/1000013-12_angry_men,Mark Jackson,Fresh,2019-12-30,"""12 Angry Men"" puts the full range of human good and evil on display. It posits that, ultimately, the universe is benevolent, and our job, regarding each other, is to attempt with our best effort and greatest compassion to elucidate and clarify the truth."
19,m/1000013-12_angry_men,Jonathan Rosenbaum,Fresh,2007-06-26,"Mechanically written, but within its own middlebrow limitations, it delivers the goods."
20,m/10003437-deep_blue,Jeff Vice,Rotten,2005-09-02,"Unfortunately, the film tries to say too much, and as a result ends up saying nothing. Also, this G-rated film contains scenes of animal attacks that are much too intense for young audiences."
21,m/10003437-deep_blue,Jonathan Holland,Fresh,2005-06-30,This majestic film has all the hallmarks of Beeb quality workmanship.
22,m/10003437-deep_blue,Harvey S. Karten,Fresh,2005-05-11,"Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly: you'll see both, nicely choreographed."
23,m/10003437-deep_blue,Bob Strauss,Fresh,2005-06-03,"It may not actually be comprehensive, but it feels like Deep Blue touches on all the points worth knowing, and more just for fun."
24,m/10003437-deep_blue,Bill White,Fresh,2005-06-30,"A trip reminding us that, while we continue to explore space, we have yet to fully penetrate the mysteries of our own planet."
25,m/10003437-deep_blue,Jami Bernard,Rotten,2005-06-03,It's about half an hour too long and Pierce Brosnan's sonorous narration threatens to lull us to sleep on those rocking waves.
26,m/10003437-deep_blue,Rich Cline,Fresh,2004-04-29,The filmmakers startlingly bring to life the beauty and balance of nature.
27,m/10003437-deep_blue,Sean P. Means,Rotten,2005-09-02,"Stunning images of undersea life, ... but the footage is pieced together haphazardly, sometimes repetitively."
28,m/10003437-deep_blue,Matthew Leyland,Fresh,2004-06-08,"Taking us from God's-eye-views of the sparkling surface to the darkest depths, this ocean odyssey conveys a riveting sense of nature's infinite variety."
29,m/10003437-deep_blue,Brian Orndorf,Fresh,2005-06-08,"Deep Blue isn't as fortunate with screen dimensions, but it works, if only because it's hard to deny the vast beauty and mysteries that lie in our abyssal oceans."
30,m/10003437-deep_blue,Andrew Wright,Rotten,2005-06-30,Lacks the connecting thesis statement that separates an above-par nature documentary from just a really cool episode of Animal Planet.
31,m/10003437-deep_blue,Nick De Semlyen,Fresh,2004-06-18,"The big screen adds extra impact to inspiring images which capture all the brutality, camaraderie and absurdity of the ocean."
32,m/10003437-deep_blue,Moira MacDonald,Fresh,2005-07-01,A sumptuous but occasionally soporific nature documentary.
33,m/10003437-deep_blue,Laura Clifford,Fresh,2003-11-04,"A nice piece of work, but unfortunately it smacks of bandwagon-jumping following the success of such docs as Winged Migration."
34,m/10003437-deep_blue,Desson Thomson,Fresh,2005-06-16,This is as good a visual treat as you and your kids can expect.
35,m/10003437-deep_blue,Rene Rodriguez,Fresh,2005-02-17,"Practically every shot in Deep Blue offers some sort of remarkable, jaw-dropping sight."
36,m/10003437-deep_blue,Marty Mapes,Rotten,2006-05-05,Deep Blue could have lived its life on TV and felt more at home
37,m/10003437-deep_blue,Erik Childress,Rotten,2005-07-01,"There's certainly enough to hold one's interest during Deep Blue, but you won't learn as much as you would through a single corridor of Chicago's Shedd Aquarium."
38,m/10003437-deep_blue,Eleanor Ringel Cater,Rotten,2005-07-14,"This is a nasty, nauseating, dispiriting movie and, to repeat, whatever you do, don't take the kids -- no matter what the G rating says."
39,m/10003437-deep_blue,Cherryl Dawson and Leigh Ann Palone,Fresh,2005-06-22,"It goes on a little too long for mostly just pretty pictures, and you get more wonder than educational detail, but it's fascinating to look at."
40,m/10005819-10005819-neverwas,Dennis Harvey,Rotten,2005-09-20,"This is the kind of movie where a madwoman's outburst leads her to throw a mug that just happens to be filled with gold sparkles -- which can then be photographed cascading down on all the adorable loonies, in slow-motion."
41,m/10005819-10005819-neverwas,David Nusair,Rotten,2005-10-02,...unlikely to find much of an audience outside of the film festival circuit.
42,m/10005819-10005819-neverwas,Jason Gorber,Rotten,2007-06-21,"Good actors are wasted, sets dominate storytelling, and it's all based on the most banal and artificial of children's tales. Avoid."
43,m/10005819-10005819-neverwas,John J. Puccio,Rotten,2007-07-03,Seems rather a waste to use name actors and then not have them actually do anything.
44,m/10005819-10005819-neverwas,Brian Webster,Rotten,2007-07-04,Writer/ director Joshua Michael Stern has crafted something more than a mess and something less than a film that hits home. Neverwas never does quite win us over.
45,m/10005819-10005819-neverwas,Jules Brenner,Rotten,2007-07-04,Never has so much talent come to so little because of a screenplay that's so adrift and aimless. Eckhart plays a psychologist with enough personal psychoses to keep himself preoccupied for a lifetime.
46,m/10005819-10005819-neverwas,Robert Roten,Fresh,2008-06-21,"At a time when most films lack subtlety, it is rare to find one as delicate, wistful and tender as 'Neverwas.'"
47,m/10008126-straightheads,Stella Papamichael,Rotten,2007-04-24,Exploitative and depressing.
48,m/10008126-straightheads,Matthew Turner,Fresh,2007-04-26,The violence may be too strong for some but this is worth seeing for a terrific performance by Gillian Anderson.
49,m/10008126-straightheads,Anthony Quinn,Rotten,2007-04-27,"Masculinity in Crisis, part 364."
50,m/10008126-straightheads,Johnny Vaughan,Fresh,2007-04-27,"Payback involving a shotgun, a kitchen table and a heap of pain."
51,m/10008126-straightheads,Jamie Russell,Rotten,2007-04-27,Make no mistake: this lo-fi rape-revenge Brit flick wants to shock you.
52,m/10008126-straightheads,Tim Robey,Rotten,2007-04-27,Country rapists have their way with Gillian Anderson and poke Danny Dyer's eye out. The duo want payback.
53,m/10008126-straightheads,Steve Rose,Rotten,2007-04-27,This nasty and nonsensical rape-revenge thriller is a feature-length exercise in wrongness.
54,m/10008126-straightheads,James Christopher,Fresh,2007-04-27,Straightheads has the pornographic ingredients of a first-rate cult thriller.
55,m/10008126-straightheads,Neil Smith,Rotten,2007-04-27,Where's Mulder when you need him.
56,m/10008126-straightheads,Anna Smith,Rotten,2007-04-27,"Anderson bares (almost) all in this flawed but fitfully fascinating thriller with a comical, if less compelling, turn from Danny Dyer."
57,m/10008126-straightheads,Derek Elley,Fresh,2007-04-27,It's clear from the start this isn't a revenge drama that's going to wimp out at the end.
58,m/10008126-straightheads,Philip French,Rotten,2007-04-30,"A repellent, ill-thought-through feature."
59,m/10008126-straightheads,Rich Cline,Rotten,2007-05-05,Feels like an experiment in suspense and violence that doesn't actually tell us anything
60,m/10008126-straightheads,Brian Webster,Rotten,2007-09-04,"The film looks professional and has a relatively big-name star in Gillian Anderson, but the screenplay - written by director Dan Reed - doesn't make a single bit of sense."
61,m/10008126-straightheads,Felix Vasquez Jr.,Fresh,2007-09-27,About how some of us would be willing to sell our souls to protect our loved ones if we had to...
62,m/10008126-straightheads,David Nusair,Fresh,2007-10-14,...a low-key drama disguised as a revenge thriller...
63,m/10008126-straightheads,Ali Gray,Rotten,2012-11-03,Straightheads is as shallow as a puddle and forgoes anything approaching realism in favour of OTT violence and needless gore.
64,m/10008234-alexandra,Dennis Schwartz,Fresh,2009-09-28,An unusual masterpiece atmospheric anti-war film that is an example of cinema as pure feeling.
65,m/10008234-alexandra,James Christopher,Fresh,2008-09-26,"Apart from a thoroughly irritating background track of schmaltzy classical music, this is Sokurov at his shortest and most digestible."
66,m/10008234-alexandra,Armond White,Fresh,2008-04-09,Sokurov's sentimental poetry embroiders a nation's personal connections to the military; he shows the ineffable grace that contemporary American filmmakers are too pent up to grant us -- truths about fealty that our movies neglect.
67,m/10008234-alexandra,Boo Allen,Rotten,2008-07-20,"Interesting look at life in the Russian military, but to what purpose?"
68,m/10008234-alexandra,Wally Hammond,Fresh,2008-09-26,"It's also quietly challenging, in its own way, not least in its portrait of old age, its trials, new freedoms and the privilege of changing one's mind before it becomes too late."
69,m/10008234-alexandra,David Parkinson,Fresh,2008-09-26,"This is war as stalemate, with Aleksandr Burov's bleached images creating an alien landscape in which colour is as rare as compassion. Rarely has combat seemed so savage or futile."
70,m/10008234-alexandra,Roger Ebert,Fresh,2008-08-08,"Remarkable, how little Sokurov tells us, while telling us so much."
71,m/10008234-alexandra,Frank Swietek,Fresh,2008-07-29,One of those pure films that's devoid of excess and overstatement...simple but searing.
72,m/10008234-alexandra,Leo Goldsmith,Fresh,2007-11-13,This is as faultless a film as I've seen in a long time - certainly my best film of 2007.
73,m/10008234-alexandra,Matthew Lucas,Fresh,2019-07-06,"A rich and rewarding film, a deeply humanist work of art that is as tender as it is bracing."
74,m/10008234-alexandra,Emanuel Levy,Fresh,2007-05-27,"Though not a top-notch Sokurov, his new film is a conceptually fascinating meditation on war seen from the perspective of an older woman who visits the battle front."
75,m/10008234-alexandra,Jon Popick,Fresh,2007-09-12,The performance of 80-year-old Vishnevskay is priceless.
76,m/10008234-alexandra,Mick LaSalle,Fresh,2008-05-30,"In the hands of visionary filmmaker Alexander Sokurov, this simple material makes for a haunting drama about war, generational relationships and the human condition."
77,m/10008234-alexandra,Sean P. Means,Fresh,2008-05-16,"The images are indelible, if somewhat inscrutable (knowing Russian history would probably help, I suppose), but the message behind them rings out like a warning alarm."
78,m/10008234-alexandra,Kevin B. Lee,Rotten,2007-10-05,"Disappointingly uncharacteristic of Sokurov, the humanist moments that pass between them lean toward token sentiment, and the moments that pass between Alexandra and the grandson she traveled so far to see feel inconsequential."
79,m/10008234-alexandra,Glenn Whipp,Fresh,2008-04-11,"There's not a shot fired in the film, but it pierces the heart nonetheless."
80,m/10008234-alexandra,Jay Weissberg,Fresh,2007-05-24,"Less accessible to general auds than The Sun, pic deserves major accolades from fests as well as discerning arthouses."
81,m/10008234-alexandra,Joseph Proimakis,Rotten,2007-10-14,"Koyrasmenos dimioyrgika kai thematika, o Sokurov prosferei mia faflatadiki dokimi ton orion tis katatonias"
82,m/10008234-alexandra,Michael Sicinski,Rotten,2017-11-27,"Alexandra is a film made by someone who wants to talk, which is an admirable gesture. It's just not the correct one."
83,m/10008234-alexandra,Derek Malcolm,Fresh,2008-09-26,Sokurov is able to say things about the terrible conflict without obvious polemic but to the maximum possible effect. That's largely why he is one of the most audacious and original directors in the world today.
84,m/10008611-my_best_friends_girl,Wesley Morris,Rotten,2008-09-22,The inexplicable romantic comedy career of Dane Cook marches on.
85,m/10008611-my_best_friends_girl,Leigh Paatsch,Rotten,2008-10-10,A film that truly bites.
86,m/10008611-my_best_friends_girl,Fred Topel,Fresh,2008-09-26,Hitch has nothing on My Best Friend's Girl... the best romance since The Notebook.
87,m/10008611-my_best_friends_girl,Stephen Cole,Rotten,2008-09-22,"An ugly, strictly-for-meatheads comedy that can only be recommended to couples who wear matching Tie Domi Toronto Maple Leafs jerseys out on a date."
88,m/10008611-my_best_friends_girl,Amy Nicholson,Fresh,2008-09-23,Cahan's curious and increasingly sincere slant on modern romance outshines its efforts to please Cook's MySpace fan base with gross-out gags (some of which are damned funny).
89,m/10008611-my_best_friends_girl,Christopher Tookey,Rotten,2008-11-21,This is one of those films that would be enormously improved by the arrival of 100 crazy Somali pirates who would proceed to take the entire cast hostage.
90,m/10008611-my_best_friends_girl,Kaleem Aftab,Rotten,2018-11-01,"Devoid of any heart, My Best Friend's Girl relies on schoolboy toilet humour to maintain interest."
91,m/10008611-my_best_friends_girl,Claudia Puig,Rotten,2008-09-22,"It borrows from much funnier movies such as Hitch, Wedding Crashers and My Best Friend's Wedding. Never has a romantic comedy seemed less romantic or less comedic."
92,m/10008611-my_best_friends_girl,Roger Moore,Rotten,2008-09-19,Isolated bits don't add up to much here.
93,m/10008611-my_best_friends_girl,David Nusair,Rotten,2009-09-28,...ultimately falls prey to the melodramatic silliness that one has come to expect from the romantic comedy genre.
94,m/10008611-my_best_friends_girl,Joe Leydon,Fresh,2008-09-19,"Cook is most amusing while emphasizing his sardonic edginess, a trait that may eventually serve him well in some anti-heroic (or downright villainous) dramatic role. Better still, he establishes an effectively fluid give-and-take with Hudson."
95,m/10008611-my_best_friends_girl,James Berardinelli,Rotten,2008-09-19,"My Best Friend's Girl isn't just a misfire; it's a misfire compounded by a chain of miscalculations, and it's hard to figure out who this could appeal to (except, perhaps, Dane Cook's fan club)."
96,m/10008611-my_best_friends_girl,Jackie K. Cooper,Rotten,2008-09-23,"Golden Girl Kate Hudson gets tarnished by associating with Dane Cook in this tasteless, terrible movie"
97,m/10008611-my_best_friends_girl,Colin Fraser,Rotten,2008-10-10,You should steer well clear of the nasty ideas that screenwriter Jordan Cahan has about relationships and how they work.
98,m/10008611-my_best_friends_girl,Laura Kern,Fresh,2008-09-22,"There are no surprises here, but speedy pacing and a smattering of laughs along the way, as well as a knowing turn by Alec Baldwin as Tank's even more piggish father, make My Best Friend's Girl a date not entirely to be skipped."
99,m/10008611-my_best_friends_girl,Gregory Kirschling,Rotten,2008-09-19,"The actors (especially Alec Baldwin, as Tank's horndog dad) elevate the material slightly, but such piffle will just fill you with longing... for a better movie."
100,m/10008611-my_best_friends_girl,Linda Cook,Rotten,2008-09-27,"Mean, crass and tasteless, ""My Best Friend's Girl"" is only pretending to be a romantic comedy."
101,m/10008611-my_best_friends_girl,Katey Rich,Rotten,2008-09-19,"It's disturbing to think of the millions of teenage boys who will laugh when he insults a girl to get her in bed, or pees in a cactus plant at a restaurant."
102,m/10008611-my_best_friends_girl,Rafer Guzman,Rotten,2008-09-19,"The movie spends a lot of time trying to be cute, vulgar and cutely vulgar. But it forgets about character, plot and believability."
103,m/10008611-my_best_friends_girl,S. Jhoanna Robledo,Rotten,2010-12-31,"Inane, raunchy romantic comedy inspires no love."
104,m/10008617-midnight_meat_train,Kurt Loder,Fresh,2008-09-26,"Japanese cult director Ryuhei Kitamura maintains impressive control of the story, ratcheting up tension toward well-prepared and startling bursts of terror."
105,m/10008617-midnight_meat_train,Keith Breese,Rotten,2009-01-03,"while skimpy on characterization and plot, it should please gorehounds and Barker fans alike"
106,m/10008617-midnight_meat_train,Luke Y. Thompson,Fresh,2008-08-04,An efficient slasher with a surprisingly slow build-up and a decent amount of originality. Plus the best use of Vinnie Jones in any movie
107,m/10008617-midnight_meat_train,Rob Nelson,Fresh,2008-08-04,"Before flying off the rails in the final curve, The Midnight Meat Train rolls quite smoothly as a mid-'80s-style psycho-killer thriller a la The Hitcher."
108,m/10008617-midnight_meat_train,Jeffrey M. Anderson,Fresh,2009-03-20,"It's excessively and imaginatively gory, presented in a straightforward manner, but with the slightest hint of a wink."
109,m/10008617-midnight_meat_train,Sean Axmaker,Fresh,2009-02-11,"... remarkably effective and, when it finally arrives at the end of the line, admirably simple."
110,m/10008617-midnight_meat_train,Anton Bitel,Fresh,2008-10-24,"a stylishly bloody descent into madness, murder and Hell itself."
111,m/10008617-midnight_meat_train,Nick Schager,Fresh,2010-03-25,So thoroughly coated in over-the-top blood and guts that even veteran genre fans will likely be astounded.
112,m/10008617-midnight_meat_train,Brian Orndorf,Rotten,2008-08-02,"We've all been here before: scarcely-lit, acid-washed cinematography; dreamlike storytelling; absurdly pitched performances; a lauded Asian filmmaker making his American debut; and plenty of CG snap to the bloodletting."
113,m/10008617-midnight_meat_train,Zena Dixon,Fresh,2018-10-14,"Overall, I recommend the film, you may or may not find it a bit dry."
114,m/10008617-midnight_meat_train,Ken Hanke,Fresh,2009-02-21,"Midnight Meat Train may be no classic of the genre, but it's certainly a better and more interesting film than most of what passes for horror movies these days."
115,m/10008617-midnight_meat_train,Scott Weinberg,Fresh,2008-07-27,Manages to maintain that sly sense of dread that permeates the best of Barker's horror tales. Certainly one of the most effective horror films of the year.
116,m/10008617-midnight_meat_train,Richard Propes,Fresh,2020-09-16,"Easily one of 2008's most pleasant, if one dares to call such a film pleasant, surprises."
117,m/10008617-midnight_meat_train,Phil Villarreal,Rotten,2009-01-28,Goes full speed on ultra-gory rails before slamming to an abrupt stop.
118,m/10008617-midnight_meat_train,Felix Vasquez Jr.,Fresh,2008-10-06,"Destined to be a cult classic as a vicious, brilliant, and disgusting horror film..."
119,m/10008617-midnight_meat_train,Brad Miska,Fresh,2008-05-02,"MEAT TRAIN is the first BOOK OF BLOOD to depart from the station in a long time and it's refreshing to see that the film carries that bleak, yet romantic touch of Clive Barker all over it... it's guaranteed to make you squirm, scream and beg for more!"
120,m/10008617-midnight_meat_train,Lucius Gore,Fresh,2009-02-09,"This is the best Clive Barker-inspired movie in a long, long time -- probably since ""Hellraiser III"" in 1992."
121,m/10008617-midnight_meat_train,Phelim O'Neill,Rotten,2008-10-31,"Japanese director Ryuhei Kitamura, who kicked off his career with 2000's impressive micro-budget zombie flick Versus, delivers plenty of stylish visuals and an admirably unrestrained attitude to gore."
122,m/10008617-midnight_meat_train,Kaleem Aftab,Fresh,2018-11-01,There is a sprightly energy to the proceedings and a neat twist that makes this mindless fun something of a guilty pleasure.

Guided by an armoury of pragmatism, common sense and dark humour, Fernando Leon de Aranoa deals a hand from a different pack of cards; one that successfully manages tone shifts."

1997,m/alphabet_killer,Rossiter Drake,Rotten,2009-01-13,"Although Schmidt and Malloy have devoted meticulous attention to Megan's manhunt, which is engrossing and briskly paced for the better part of 85 minutes, their final act seems less like a canny trick than a copout."
1998,m/alphabet_killer,Avi Offer,Rotten,2009-01-31,The Alphabet Killer suffers from the same symptoms as Passengers: both have an unintentionally feeble-minded character who lazily investigates a mystery while the plot itself seems dull and poorly developed.
1999,m/alphabet_killer,Pablo Villaça,Rotten,2009-04-10,"Chega a impressionar que, em meio a tantos elementos desastrosos, a atuação de Eliza Dushku (que também co-produziu o longa) seja inegavelmente a pior coisa do filme."

2015,m/altered_states,Emanuel Levy,Fresh,2005-07-02,"Though deviating from Paddy Chayefsky's script (and novel), the reliably flamboyant Ken Russell made a spooky but engaging psycho-horror film about experimentation with human consciousness that deservedly received Oscar nods for sound and music."
2016,m/altered_states,John J. Puccio,Fresh,2012-07-15,"Think of it as an extravagant and exhilarating, if over-the-top, piece of filmmaking that's silly, to be sure, but engrossing at the same time."

2401,m/avengers_endgame,Robert Roten,Fresh,2019-05-03,"One Avengers movie to bind them, and in the darkness rule them all."
2402,m/avengers_endgame,Vincent Schilling,Fresh,2019-08-22,Avengers: Endgame is REAL great ... with an emphasis on real. Would have been my first 10 rated review ... but they killed my favorite heroes. 'Cheeseburgers...'

2404,m/avengers_endgame,Pablo Villaça,Fresh,2019-05-10,"It's revealing that after 22 movies packed with action and fantasy, the franchise chose to end its narrative with a small moment of intimacy and sweetness. [Full review in Portuguese]"
2405,m/avengers_endgame,Oliver Jones,Fresh,2019-05-01,"What you will be getting when you walk into an inevitably overstuffed movie theater is something singular that reflects our age in a way that none of the MCU films that preceded it have-indeed, very few Hollywood spectacles ever have."
2406,m/avengers_endgame,Armond White,Rotten,2019-04-26,"Endgame's three-hour length suggests profundity, but each bout of knuckle-busting between the specially gifted vigilantes and the demonic Thanos either panders or, at best, is merely redundant."
2407,m/avengers_endgame,Blake Crane,Fresh,2019-04-28,"[As] a finale to the MCU we've known since 2008's Iron Man, Avengers: Endgame is an exciting, fitting, substantial, almost miraculously eloquent closer."
2408,m/avengers_endgame,Matthew Turner,Fresh,2019-04-26,"Just about the best send-off imaginable, a stunning achievement in blockbuster cinema and a satisfying resolution to a phenomenal run of films."
2409,m/avengers_endgame,Zaki Hasan,Fresh,2019-04-25,"Spellbinding, surprising, and immensely satisfying. Eleven years, twenty-two films, one singular cinematic achievement the likes of which we've never seen before and aren't likely to again for a long time to come"
2410,m/avengers_endgame,Chase Whale,Fresh,2019-04-24,Avengers: Endgame is not just a remarkable movie; it's an unforgettable experience.

2412,m/avengers_endgame,Tom Santilli,Fresh,2019-04-24,"...while End Game is a crowd-pleaser through and through, what wasn't expected was for this last chapter to pack such an emotional wallop."
2413,m/avengers_endgame,Kate Sánchez,Fresh,2019-04-26,"Overall, Avengers: Endgameis an unflinching and beautiful love letter to both comic books and the fans who have sustained the MCU."
2414,m/avengers_endgame,Kent Garrison,Fresh,2019-04-29,Endgame's true feat is how it flawlessly subverts our expectations without feeling like betrayal.

2416,m/avengers_endgame,Perri Nemiroff,Fresh,2019-04-26,"...A wonderful, rousing payoff in the context of the big battle and as wildly inspiring imagery."
2417,m/avengers_endgame,Andrew Parker,Fresh,2019-04-24,"It's a worthy bookend to an ambitious cycle of interlocking blockbusters, credible fan service, and far and away the best film to have Avengers in the title."
2418,m/avengers_endgame,Lauren Bradshaw,Fresh,2019-04-26,"Avengers: Endgame is a crowd-pleaser at the highest level, striking the perfect balance of paying homage to its predecessors and giving each character his/her moment to shine."
2419,m/avp2,James O'Ehley,Rotten,2008-01-04,After Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem it would be best to simply retire both these by-now over-familiar movie monsters . . .
2420,m/avp2,Brent Simon,Fresh,2007-12-28,"Chocolate-and-peanut-butter franchise mash-up corrects its most recent predecessor's PG-13 rating, but offers up neither originality nor knockout execution."
2421,m/avp2,Peter Sobczynski,Rotten,2007-12-26,It makes Alien Vs. Predator look like Alien or Predator by comparison.
2422,m/avp2,Nick Schager,Rotten,2008-01-20,"Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem is literally shrouded in darkness, and the only explicable reason for this pitch-black visual schema is that the filmmakers understood it was better if no one could see the **** they were shooting."
2423,m/avp2,Sarah Cartland,Rotten,2018-11-10,"So dark it's mostly impossible to see what's going on, which is probably a blessing as the imagery I could see was an unpleasant mix of motherhood and sexual violence."
2424,m/avp2,Pablo Villaça,Rotten,2008-01-11,"Fez com que eu percebesse que, de repente, estar no meio de uma guerra entre duas criaturas mortais pode não ser um destino tão horrível como eu imaginava. Ao menos, eu estaria livre de acompanhar esta série."
2425,m/avp2,Jason Anderson,Rotten,2007-12-28,That the first of many rote 'chest-burster' shots occurs 15 seconds into the movie is but one indication of the latest instalment's poverty of fresh shocks and rank air of desperation.
2426,m/avp2,Maitland McDonagh,Rotten,2007-12-28,Delivers what it promises and not much more.
2427,m/avp2,Beth Accomando,Rotten,2007-12-28,"Now the studio has smartly served up an R-rated sequel so the blood could flow, and it does. Unfortunately, it doesn't flow with much imagination."
2428,m/avp2,Kevin A. Ranson,Rotten,2008-01-16,... why not just film an intergalactic reality show where eager young predators can prove their worth for fabulous prizes by surviving 24 hours on the alien homeworld?
2429,m/avp2,Frank Swietek,Rotten,2007-12-26,"Not good, mind you, but probably about as efficient an example of an unnecessary sequel as was possible under the circumstances."
2430,m/avp2,Ryan Stewart,Fresh,2008-01-02,"I can't recommend it as a good movie on its own merits, stocked as it is with cardboard cutout characters and a barely coherent plot, but it's miles more interesting than the last Alien vs. Predator film"
2431,m/avp2,Debbie Lynn Elias,Rotten,2019-11-06,"The word ""requiem"" is defined as a ""mass for the dead."" Let us now hold our own requiem , because thanks to ALIEN VERSUS PREDATOR: REQUIEM ... two of my favorite franchises, Alien and Predator, are surely now dead."
2432,m/avp2,Staci Layne Wilson,Rotten,2007-12-29,"None of the aliens or predators have one whit of personality or individualism, and the human actors might as well have been cardboard cutouts with empty thought-bubbles."
2433,m/avp2,Andrew Wright,Rotten,2007-12-26,It's a Wonderful Life is no longer the most depressing Christmas movie ever made.
2434,m/avp2,Jurgen Fauth,Rotten,2008-06-13,"Too underlit to qualify as splatter, too bloodless to qualify as fun, too unaware of its own idiocy to be enjoyed Grindhouse-style, AvP:R is a real education in the finer stratifications of badness."
2435,m/avp2,Jim Lane,Rotten,2008-01-17,"...wastes no money on stars, no time on plot or character, and no lighting on the set..."
2436,m/avp2,Richard Propes,Rotten,2020-09-01,The obligatory climactic battle is a pathetic letdown.
2437,m/avp2,Jeffrey Chen,Rotten,2010-11-15,"In a word, repugnant."
2438,m/avp2,Joshua Tyler,Rotten,2007-12-25,"A movie every bit as awkward and laborious as its unwieldy, ridiculous title."
2439,m/awol_2017,Dennis Harvey,Fresh,2016-04-17,"""AWOL"" holds attention with its strong lead performances, nicely etched support turns, and nuanced portrait of a downwardly mobile ""heartland"" Caucasian America too seldom portrayed in movies given the large chunk of the populace it encompasses."
2440,m/awol_2017,Allyson Johnson,Fresh,2016-04-21,"With simply stunning visuals and a powerhouse performance by Kirke, AWOL isn't likely to make any big screen impressions but will make its mark in the smaller market that it lands on."
2441,m/awol_2017,Jason Bailey,Fresh,2016-04-26,"It's an authentic and emotional film, with first-rate turns by Wool and especially Kirk."
2442,m/awol_2017,Katie Walsh,Fresh,2016-05-18,"Shoval ... captures the blind recklessness of first love, in a lesbian love story that's only partially about the characters' queerness."
2443,m/awol_2017,Maria Vultaggio,Fresh,2017-02-06,It grabs the audience's attention from the beginning.
2444,m/awol_2017,Sarah Ward,Fresh,2017-03-21,"An affecting clash between yearning to escape your fate, and knowing that truly leaving something or somewhere behind isn't easy."
2445,m/awol_2017,Alex Heeney,Fresh,2017-07-12,This love story is as much about the specificity of their socio-economic positions as it is about the effects of homophobia.
2446,m/awol_2017,Joe Reid,Fresh,2017-12-20,AWOL is a very modest indie - and it could really have used a re-think on its gratingly obvious score - but it's rewarding in a lot of ways.
2447,m/awol_2017,Christopher Llewellyn Reed,Fresh,2018-02-03,Every scene is both light on its feet and weighted with potential import; we never know what is leading where until we're at our destination.
2448,m/awol_2017,Morgan Rojas,Fresh,2018-08-06,"Deb Shoval creates a love story that is wrapped up in euphoria, confusion, and heartache all at once and portrays a pretty accurate depiction of messy love."
2449,m/awol_2017,Stephen Saito,Fresh,2018-11-13,"A muscular debut, modest in the scale of its storytelling, but not in the empathy it inspires and though it may have taken years to complete, ""AWOL"" was well worth the wait."
2450,m/awol_2017,Sarah Fonseca,Fresh,2018-11-13,"Talking about class can be ugly. Yet as AWOL asserts, when you dare to comment, sometimes it frees up room for beauty to unfurl."
2451,m/awol_2017,Nathanael Hood,Rotten,2018-12-28,"Completely bereft of momentum, it staggers and stumbles its torturous way through an eighty five-minute run-time without offering anything creative or original."
2452,m/awol_2017,John DeFore,Fresh,2019-01-08,"Cinematographer Gal Deren's lensing of Rust Belt locations finds a place both lovely to linger in and worth leaving, matching the bittersweet sound of the folky songs Kirke sings while the two characters are alone."
2453,m/awol_2017,Andrea Thompson,Fresh,2019-02-05,"[Lola] Kirke gives an amazing performance, but it's [Breeda] Wool who has the harder role, and effortlessly shines."

2455,m/babettes_feast,John A. Nesbit,Fresh,2013-08-14,essentially a fable ... stands the test of time
2456,m/babettes_feast,Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat,Fresh,2002-09-01,A literate and lovely-to-look-at film that compels us to meditate upon the needs of the flesh and the gifts of the spirit.
2457,m/babettes_feast,David Jenkins,Fresh,2012-12-13,"Light, frothy and sweet on the tongue, but lacking nutrition."
2458,m/babettes_feast,Gene Siskel,Fresh,2018-12-06,It's a strangely moving film about talents and passions used and not used.

2464,m/babettes_feast,Emanuel Levy,Fresh,2006-11-07,"Despite the austerity of the characters and local, this quiet gentle Danish film, the surprise winner of the 1987 Best Foreign Oscar, won over audiences with its subject of food, and the preparartion of a feast to end all feasts-- by Stephane Audran!"
2465,m/babettes_feast,Steven D. Greydanus,Fresh,2002-05-08,"A quiet celebration of the divine grace that meets us at every turn, and even redeems our ways not taken, our sacrifices and losses."
2466,m/babettes_feast,Peter Bradshaw,Fresh,2012-12-13,"Twenty-five years on, the story is still charming and beguiling."
2467,m/babettes_feast,Dan Jardine,Fresh,2013-08-09,"Babette's offering is a ritual sacrifice, intended to encourage the austere characters with the possibility that their material nourishment may provide spiritual sustenance as well."
2468,m/babettes_feast,Dan Jardine,Fresh,2001-09-24,"At turns philosophical and sensual, this hauntingly elegaic film resonates."
2469,m/babettes_feast,Molly Haskell,Fresh,2020-02-27,A movie whose special quality lies in the play of irony beneath its somber surface.
2470,m/babettes_feast,Antonio Sison,Fresh,2019-04-30,"Nourishing both the senses and the religious imagination with its profound representation of food and eating, the Oscar winner for Best Foreign Language Film remains the gold standard for food films."

2474,m/bachelorette,John Beifuss,Rotten,2012-10-19,"The actresses are thoroughly committed to the memorable roles they boldly inhabit, but the performers as well as the characters deserve a less compromised vehicle."
2475,m/bachelorette,Elizabeth Weitzman,Rotten,2012-09-06,What's actually off-putting about this movie is how desperate the filmmakers are to exploit other people's ideas.
2476,m/bachelorette,James Verniere,Fresh,2012-09-07,"A supposedly raunchier and 'darker' version of 'Bridesmaids' (it isn't), the film is beautifully cast and funny."
2477,m/bachelorette,Kristin Tillotson,Rotten,2012-09-06,"""Bachelorette"" commits only one crime, but it's a make-or-break offense -- it's just not quite funny enough."
2478,m/bachelorette,Matt Neal,Fresh,2012-11-18,"The performances and characters are the best thing about Bachelorette, which tries to walk a fine line between bawdy gross-out comedy and introspective ""what have I done with my life?"" drama for 30-somethings."
2479,m/bachelorette,Claudia Puig,Rotten,2012-09-06,"Talented actors are wasted in a film that induces more cringes than chuckles as women old enough to know better act like horny sailors on leave, absorb mass quantities of alcohol and drugs, and generally behave horribly."
2480,m/bachelorette,Owen Gleiberman,Fresh,2012-08-29,"Bachelorette is expertly shot and paced, with a script that's as cutting as a serrated knife."
2481,m/bachelorette,Marshall Fine,Rotten,2012-09-05,Comedies in which women talk dirty and act stupid and horny - is this such a hard to genre to get right?
2482,m/bachelorette,S. Jhoanna Robledo,Fresh,2012-09-04,"Mean girls get nicer in raucous, raunchy party comedy."
2483,m/bachelorette,Mary F. Pols,Fresh,2012-09-06,"The best reason to see Bachelorette is Dunst, once a child star with an uncanny ability to project maturity, now an actress with an ever-increasing range."
2484,m/bachelorette,Emily Rems,Rotten,2017-03-07,Bridesmaids it's not.
2485,m/bachelorette,Connie Ogle,Fresh,2012-09-06,"Bachelorette will no doubt be divisive, possibly along generational lines. If you have to ask ""Do women really talk this way?"" it's not for you."
2486,m/bachelorette,Thomas Caldwell,Fresh,2012-10-31,The material becomes increasingly uncomfortable since it mainly comes from sad and traumatic places. This is what gives the film its edge.
2487,m/bachelorette,Stephen Whitty,Fresh,2012-09-07,"Its actresses - particularly Dunst - are terrific. Headland has a nice feel for music, too, and takes some editing risks."
2488,m/bachelorette,Philip Martin,Fresh,2012-09-21,"...there's no soft center here, no sweetness lurking to cut the tart. This is a raw and genuinely brave film that falters here and there, but gets up swearing and snarling, a razor in its pretty little hand."
2489,m/bachelorette,Roger Moore,Rotten,2012-09-06,"What writer-director Leslye Headland has given us is a romp that never quite romps, a teary-eyed string of taking-stock moments without tears, and a serious squandering of major league movie talent."
2490,m/bachelorette,Betty Jo Tucker,Rotten,2012-09-07,"Don't worry, 'Bridesmaids.' This latest wedding hijinks comedy ends up as a silly rip-off that tries to capitalize on your success. But you're still Number One!"
2491,m/bachelorette,Dana Stevens,Fresh,2012-09-14,A nasty little piece of work -- a phrase I use not with contempt but with grudging admiration.
2492,m/bachelorette,Richard Roeper,Rotten,2012-08-30,I'm ready to forget I ever saw it.
2493,m/bachelorette,Simon Miraudo,Rotten,2012-10-29,"Leslye Headland's bitterly unfunny Bachelorette not only squanders a talented cast of comic performers, but also chastises the audience for revelling in the unfiltered awfulness of their characters."

2496,m/back_to_1942,Andrew L. Urban,Fresh,2012-11-24,"Disaster movie and war movie in one dramatic realisation of a dark chapter in China's history, Back to 1942 is epic in its intentions and its scope"
2497,m/back_to_1942,Sheri Linden,Rotten,2012-11-29,"Director Feng Xiaogang captures the epic scale of the exodus as well as the often-harrowing details, yet emotional connection proves more elusive."
2498,m/back_to_1942,Bruce DeMara,Rotten,2012-11-29,"A chronicle of unrelenting misery, sorrow and human degradation that has powerful moments but is hardly uplifting."
2499,m/back_to_1942,Neil Genzlinger,Rotten,2012-11-29,It catalogs agony without making you feel it.
2500,m/back_to_1942,Jay Weissberg,Rotten,2012-11-29,"Shifting between individual suffering (performed, not felt) and extended political and business deliberations, the pic displays its budget but not its heart."
2501,m/back_to_1942,Deborah Young,Rotten,2012-11-29,"There is surprisingly little emotional resonance with the well-drawn and acted characters, making it a tiring two and a half hour trek for filmgoers who don't have a stake in the history it recounts."
2502,m/back_to_1942,Daniel Eagan,Fresh,2012-11-30,"A relatively even-handed account of a famine which killed three million people, but the storytelling is so careful that it fails to build much interest or emotion."
2503,m/back_to_1942,Mark Jenkins,Fresh,2012-11-30,"""Back to 1942"" shows the director's mastery of chaotic spectacle, massed human motion and elegant camera movements."

2508,m/back_to_the_future,Sheila Benson,Rotten,2013-06-26,"It's big, cartoonish and empty, with an interesting premise that is underdeveloped and overproduced."
2509,m/back_to_the_future,Shawn Bowers,Fresh,2003-08-29,"Part II was better, but that's just me. The first one is a fun romp too."
2510,m/back_to_the_future,Nick Davis,Fresh,2004-11-02,"Technically, no film is impossible to like, but this techno-romantic comedy comes about as close as you can get."
2511,m/back_to_the_future,Jay Boyar,Fresh,2013-06-26,It isn't often that extremely clever moviemakers use their brains in the service of pure fun. But that's just what the people who made Back to the Future have done. This brilliant contraption of a film could become the hit of the summer.
2512,m/back_to_the_future,Steven D. Greydanus,Fresh,2005-10-10,"Equal parts hilarity, nostalgia, science fiction, screwball comedy, and white-knuckle suspense in a complex storyline wound tighter than a yo-yo in a centrifuge."

2534,m/bad_day_for_the_cut,Brian Tallerico,Fresh,2017-01-26,"A taut vengeance thriller that doesn't completely come together as one would hope but has enough solid entertainment value, well-directed visuals, and nasty twists and turns to justify a look."
2535,m/bad_day_for_the_cut,Andrew Marshall,Fresh,2017-06-30,"There is a strong suggestion that cycles of vengeance merely go around and around, an observation of particular poignancy for a country with a recent history so mired in conflict and one that in making Bad Day for the Cut is at its most insightful."

2543,m/bad_turn_worse,Andrew O'Hehir,Fresh,2014-11-12,"Southern does a nice job balancing out the super-obvious plot twists with the ones you don't see coming, and even when the characters more cannily constructed than realistic, the Hawkins brothers and the cast play it pretty straight."
2544,m/bad_turn_worse,Robert Abele,Rotten,2014-11-13,"""Bad Turn Worse"" simply peters out by the night of the big heist, never achieving more than being imitative of small-town noir instead of getting inside it."
2545,m/bad_turn_worse,Drew Hunt,Fresh,2014-11-13,"This cowboy noir works fine as a genre riff, but screenwriter Dutch Southern draws so liberally on the work of Jim Thompson, Cormac McCarthy, and the Coen brothers that he ought to take them all out for drinks."

2553,m/bad_turn_worse,Todd Gilchrist,Fresh,2013-09-24,"Gorgeously photographed, the Hawkins' film has a functionality to their work that doesn't add too many unnecessary flourishes, but it exudes a grace that elevates what might have been purely cliched material to something more special."
2554,m/bad_turn_worse,Anita Katz,Fresh,2014-11-14,"The Hawkins brothers make the action compelling, nicely capture small-town dead-endedness, and provide emotional voltage throughout. Peformances, too, are impressive, with Pellegrino a standout as the baddie."
2555,m/bad_turn_worse,Chase Whale,Fresh,2014-04-08,"We Gotta Get Out of This Place is screenwriter Dutch Southern's first produced script, and please God, don't let it be his last.

2556,m/bad_turn_worse,Travis M. Andrews,Fresh,2014-11-21,"Bad Turn Worse isn't bad, it's simply generic, but it owns its genre with such swagger one can't help but look forward to seeing these actors, directors and writer in action again."

2568,m/bakery_in_brooklyn,John Hartl,Rotten,2017-01-19,"You never feel connected to couples who are clearly supposed to be infatuated. It's left to the actors to pull off the illusion, and they fail almost immediately."

2574,m/balls_of_fury,Christopher Smith,Rotten,2007-09-03,"In spite of what's its title suggests, ""Balls of Fury"" isn't a sex comedy. The balls of fury here are ping-pong balls, and they disappoint."

2584,m/balls_of_fury,Kam Williams,Fresh,2007-09-01,"A breakout role for Dan Fogler, who comes across as a combination of Johns Belushi and Candy, exhibiting the former's unbounded enthusiasm, and the latter's ever-endearing charm. Just remember to check your brain at the box-office."

2591,m/banana_split_2020,Peter Bradshaw,Rotten,2020-06-03,"The fundamental premise of this never really looks anything other than muddled and implausible, and certainly doesn't free up the relationship between Marks and Liberato in any satisfyingly comic direction."
2592,m/banana_split_2020,Sara Clements,Fresh,2020-03-26,"Banana Split, a clever name for the love triangle between these three vanilla scoops, is an exploration of a complicated yet genuine female friendship that's rare to see in a film of the genre."

2606,m/banana_split_2020,Stephen Saito,Fresh,2018-10-02,"Not only is there a great casual beauty in how Banana Split looks... but in the sheer goodness to be found in April and Clara's friendship, soon going bowling and shopping at thrift stores together."

2664,m/bartleby_2002,Chuck Wilson,Fresh,2002-06-01,"While Parker and co-writer Catherine di Napoli are faithful to Melville's plotline, they and a fully engaged supporting cast ... have made the old boy's characters more quick-witted than any English Lit major would have thought possible."
2665,m/bartleby_2002,Megan Turner,Rotten,2002-05-24,File under B for boring.
2666,m/bartleby_2002,Eleanor Ringel Cater,Rotten,2002-11-04,What was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical.
2667,m/bartleby_2002,Jocelyn Szczepaniak-Gillece,Fresh,2002-05-31,"Funny, somber, absurd, and, finally, achingly sad, Bartleby is a fine, understated piece of filmmaking."
2668,m/battle_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,John A. Nesbit,Rotten,2000-01-01,"With the budgets decreasing, creative ideas waning, and costumes and makeup getting more worn-out, it's a good thing that this is the final sequel."

2671,m/battle_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,Tom Coates,Rotten,2001-06-19,"The Planet of the Apes series started well, and gradually decreased in budget and quality. By Battle the budget is all but gone, and all the believability and excitement has gone with it."
2672,m/battle_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,Max Messier,Rotten,2001-08-01,At least it is only 83 minutes long.
2673,m/battle_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,Scott Weinberg,Fresh,2002-07-25,"Fans will enjoy it, but the ""Apes"" gang could have done a little better. Not surprisingly, this was the fifth and last installment. (Unless you count the TV show...)"

2679,m/battle_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,Rob Gonsalves,Fresh,2007-04-09,An okay finale.
2680,m/battle_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,Michael Scheinfeld,Rotten,2007-06-04,"Aside from Severn Darden, who relishes his lip-smacking heavy character, the cast seems disinterested; even series stalwart Roddy McDowall looks bored."
2681,m/battle_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,Steve Crum,Fresh,2008-03-22,Unnecessary sequel is nonetheless entertaining; Roddy Mcdowall back in simian shape.

2683,m/battle_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,Chris Alexander,Fresh,2018-09-17,"Battle ends with a deep sense of melancholy and grace, a timeline defying notion that Caesar's decency in fact altered the course of history."
2684,m/battle_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,Zaki Hasan,Rotten,2018-10-31,"Some solid ideas at its center expounding on the series' omnipresent themes of race relations and destiny vs. free will, but is hobbled by its too-apparent dime-store budget and a singular lack of ambition."
2685,m/battle_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,Dick Lochte,Rotten,2019-12-31,"The problem here is basically one of script, though the lowering of production values has taken its toll."
2686,m/battle_of_the_sexes,Kt Schaefer,Fresh,2018-11-08,The acting in Battle of the Sexes is what elevates it well beyond the average sports film.
2687,m/battle_of_the_sexes,Matt Cipolla,Rotten,2020-07-23,"[I]t never replicates the agency or daringness of its protagonist, refusing its multiple opportunities for more effective drama or satire regarding institutionalized misogyny."
2688,m/battle_of_the_sexes,Fiona Underhill,Fresh,2020-07-12,"A shame that it doesn't really get to grips with the motivations of the characters or gives enough context about the feminist movement of the time. Ultimately; great performances, shame about the script. Worth it for Andrea Riseborough alone."
2689,m/battle_of_the_sexes,Liz Braun,Fresh,2017-09-21,"Under an entertaining story of two high-profile people who came to represent social upheaval on a tennis court, the Battle of the Sexes is also a timely reminder of the backsliding currently going on in America."
2690,m/battle_of_the_sexes,Doug Jamieson,Fresh,2019-01-30,"Battle of the Sexes may not dig deep enough into the real issues surrounding women's rights in the 1970s, but it is endlessly entertaining and genuinely inspiring."
2691,m/battle_of_the_sexes,Mick LaSalle,Fresh,2017-09-21,"In its focus on King, it's ... a compelling internal story, demonstrating that athletic achievement is not only a matter of physical gifts. At the highest levels, where the pressure is greatest, it really comes down to character."
2692,m/battle_of_the_sexes,Jim Slotek,Fresh,2017-09-20,"The ""Battle Of The Sexes"" was the 1973 tennis exhibition that, as overhyped spectacle, was the Mayweather/McGregor match of its day. And it's fleshed out as first-rate soap in the movie of the same name starring Emma Stone and Steve Carell."

2695,m/battle_of_the_sexes,Manohla Dargis,Fresh,2017-09-21,"It was personal and it was political, which ""Battle of the Sexes"" gets. It was also entertainment, which is where the movie really excels."
2696,m/battle_of_the_sexes,Matt Ward,Rotten,2018-11-07,"A solid, yet flawed biopic that does justice to its subject matter without rising to an elite level."
2697,m/battle_of_the_sexes,Dustin Putman,Fresh,2017-09-21,"A stirring, affectionately felt biopic about a necessary milestone in sports history. The not-so-secret weapon of ""Battle of the Sexes"" is Billie Jean King herself, and Emma Stone's impassioned turn playing her."
2698,m/battle_of_the_sexes,MaryAnn Johanson,Fresh,2017-09-21,"An essential history lesson with a smart smack of relevance for today (because feminism always has to be relitigated). It's also warm, funny, and hugely entertaining."
2699,m/battle_of_the_sexes,Sean P. Means,Fresh,2017-09-29,"The joyous movie Battle of the Sexes covers every inch of the court -- as an inspirational sports drama, as a riotous comedy, as a tender romance and as an insightful biography of King and her pivotal role in the fight for women's equality."
2700,m/battle_of_the_sexes,Carl Kozlowski,Fresh,2017-12-28,Battle is an extremely well-made movie artistically and should be kept in the game as a contender for critics' honors and the Oscars at the end of the year.
2701,m/battle_of_the_sexes,Sean Mulvihill,Rotten,2018-10-31,Battle of the Sexes is just a flat biopic that more often than not feels like a bad parody.
2702,m/battle_of_the_sexes,Travis Hopson,Fresh,2017-09-21,The film is at its best when the lens is tightened on the personal factors that led to King and Riggs' showdown.

2704,m/battle_of_the_sexes,Graeme Tuckett,Fresh,2017-09-28,"Battle of the Sexes does many things wonderfully well. It tells a complex story with clarity, brevity and wit. It establishes a couple of superbly well-written and played characters."
2705,m/battle_of_the_sexes,Michael Smith,Fresh,2017-10-05,"Battle of the Sexes serves up a history lesson and a message of equality that is as timely now as it was more than 40 years ago, but it's a bit too soft to call the film a grand-slam winner."

2709,m/battleship_potemkin,Joshua Rothkopf,Fresh,2011-01-12,"For a piece of propaganda, this has a lot more artfulness than you'll recall, replete with quiet moments of public mourning and a stirring flag-hoisting (dyed red on the new print, too)."
2710,m/battleship_potemkin,Sam Wigley,Fresh,2011-04-26,"Nearly 90 years on, Eisenstein's masterpiece is still guaranteed to get the pulse racing."
2711,m/battleship_potemkin,Ken Hanke,Fresh,2003-08-24,"Theories of montage and Eisenstein's developments to the language of cinema to one side, Potemkin is first and foremost a powerfully visceral film. Its very lack of subtlety works in its favor. The film is not a meditation, it's a shout."
2712,m/battleship_potemkin,Roger Ebert,Fresh,2000-01-01,"Battleship Potemkin is no longer considered the greatest film ever made, but it is obligatory for anyone interested in film history."

2716,m/battleship_potemkin,Pamela Hutchinson,Fresh,2020-03-18,"Because Battleship Potemkin is an appeal to fellow-feeling and collective action, it is only right that the restoration work creates a more immersive film, one that places no barriers between a 21st-century audience and its monumentally powerful imagery."
2717,m/battleship_potemkin,Helen Grace,Fresh,2001-06-06,"It is still a pleasure to view again a film which, without fully knowing it, wrote the grammar of cinema."
2718,m/battleship_potemkin,Geoff Andrew,Fresh,2006-01-26,"Edward Tiss's camerawork remains impressive, and there's no doubt that the whole is a technical tour de force, but the obsession with forces of power, as opposed to individual experience, is ultimately oppressive."
2719,m/battleship_potemkin,Robert Herring,Fresh,2015-12-12,"The thing that matters is that Soviet [cinema], while being propagandist, contains a use of all the different branches of film-making which is recognised and practised in no other country."
2720,m/battleship_potemkin,Wilella Waldorf,Fresh,2020-10-08,"Potemkin tells, with a good deal of striking detail and with considerable pictorial effectiveness, a stern narrative of mutiny and revolt."
2721,m/battleship_potemkin,Nick Hilditch,Fresh,2001-04-17,"If you are at all interested in the history of cinema, or the influence of 20th century politics on the medium, then this film is a must-see, although over an hour of Soviet propaganda is likely to test the patience of modern viewers."
2722,m/battleship_potemkin,Emanuel Levy,Fresh,2007-10-28,"Capturing a unique moment in time, Eisentsein's 1925 masterpiece is a must-see for viewers interested in film theory, history, and aesthetics, and not just because of its seminal Odessa Steps sequence, later imitated by many directors."
2723,m/battleship_potemkin,Josh Larsen,Fresh,2008-09-08,Eisenstein proved himself to be the first of what would become a familiar filmmaking type: the entertainer/sadist.

2729,m/be_with_me,Michael Atkinson,Fresh,2006-09-26,"Sometimes clumsy and dry, always sympathetic, and wryly interested in the impact food has on social intercourse, Be With Me is eventually affecting once its elliptical shape becomes clear."
2730,m/be_with_me,Stephen Holden,Fresh,2006-09-28,"Although four stories are folded together in Eric Khoos elliptical film, it's the true story of a deaf and blind Singaporean woman that gives the movie its backbone."

2736,m/beast_stalker,G. Allen Johnson,Fresh,2009-05-15,A movie that has all the best elements of a great Hong Kong action film: It's over the top and ingeniously plotted (even if that plot strains credibility) and never stops moving.
2737,m/beast_stalker,Nathanael Hood,Fresh,2018-07-16,"Beast Stalker isn't interested in traditional narrative logic, indulging in the extreme emotional pathos of its far-fetched scenario and the occasional glimpses of humanity that can shine through in even the worst circumstances."

2764,m/beauty_and_the_beast_2014,Dan Seitz,Fresh,2016-09-23,"It's a fun, beautiful drama that's a good way to while away two hours. But if Gans had been able to dial it back just a bit, he might have had something even better."
2765,m/beauty_and_the_beast_2014,Sebastian Zavala Kahn,Fresh,2018-01-30,"An unexpected success; a film that's received little to no promotion here in Peru, but that ended up being really good. [Full review in Spanish]"
2766,m/beauty_and_the_beast_2014,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,Rotten,2016-09-22,"Belongs to the most rote category of interpretations, hinting at nothing darker than a fascination with sulking bad boys bored by wealth."

2772,m/beauty_and_the_beast_2014,Stefan Pape,Rotten,2014-02-19,"Beauty and the Beast is one of the great, traditional love stories and this film simply feels devoid of any such romanticism, with no chemistry or spark between our protagonists of any kind."
2773,m/beauty_and_the_beast_2014,Peter Sobczynski,Fresh,2016-09-23,Gans and Co. have given us a sumptuous and highly watchable take on the story that is a more than worthy work in its own right.
2774,m/beauty_and_the_beast_2014,Dustin Putman,Fresh,2017-02-21,"Works better as cinematic spectacle than as compassionate romantic drama. Fortunately, their afterthought of a romance dampens but does not spoil the movie's cumulatively handsome spell."

2778,m/beauty_and_the_beast_2014,Luke Y. Thompson,Fresh,2016-09-21,...it's rich in visual imagination. If only there were a little more faith in the visuals' ability to tell the story by themselves.

2793,m/being_there,Roger Ebert,Fresh,2000-01-01,"Satire is a threatened species in American film, and when it does occur, it's usually broad and slapstick, as in the Mel Brooks films. Being There, directed by Hal Ashby, is a rare and subtle bird that finds its tone and stays with it."
2794,m/being_there,Ryan Cracknell,Fresh,2009-02-06,"Sellers uses simple looks and gestures to bring light to some very serious situations. At many points it's like he's in a trance, truly embodying Chance."
2795,m/being_there,CJ Sheu,Fresh,2020-07-01,"That ... Chance [is] perfectly aware of when others expect his contribution and of that contribution's general tenor, is nothing short of a high-wire act."
2796,m/being_there,Walter Chaw,Rotten,2009-05-20,a product not of Ashby's essential modesty but of Kosinski's essential egoism.
2797,m/being_there,Peter Canavese,Fresh,2009-01-31,"Whether Being There is an indictment of our narrow view of the world, a celebration of empty-headedness or all of the above, ""Life is a state of mind,"" and Ashby's film is a gift to treasure. [Blu-ray]"

2801,m/believe_me,Chris Klimek,Rotten,2014-09-24,Believe Me is a textbook lesson in how glossy cinematography and an appealing cast can compensate for an undercooked script.

2808,m/believe_me,David Noh,Rotten,2014-09-26,"But an overall generic blandness keeps this from being a truly entertaining snark-fest. Those frat brothers are rather interchangeable smart-alecks, with a callowness that prevents viewer empathy."

2811,m/believe_me,MaryAnn Johanson,Rotten,2014-09-26,Not your typical Christian film: it dares to question the money-making machine that is evangelicalism. But it doesn't dare question Christianity itself.
2812,m/believe_me,Josh Kupecki,Rotten,2014-09-25,"What is most egregious, and seems completely lost on the filmmakers, is that the film is the very thing it attempts to expose: a pandering cash-in on faith-based films disguising itself as an honest examination of belief."
2813,m/believe_me,Mark R. Leeper,Rotten,2014-09-26,It would be easy to come away feeling BELIEVE ME was a religious bait-and-switch with an especially Christian message.

2817,m/believe_me,Frank Swietek,Rotten,2014-09-26,"There are moments when the movie hits the target. Unfortunately, they're not enough to raise what might have been a sharp, perceptive take on the rah-rah side of modern Christianity above the level of mediocrity."
2818,m/believe_me,James Kendrick,Fresh,2014-10-06,"The balancing act they manage in poking fun at evangelical culture ... while not blatantly mocking organized religion and, more importantly, people's faith, is impressive"
2819,m/believe_me,Nell Minow,Fresh,2014-09-30,"A remarkably smart, funny, brave, and heartfelt first feature film -- Bakke has a sharp eye but a warm heart and a refreshing honesty."
2820,m/believe_me,Jeannette Catsoulis,Fresh,2014-09-25,"A smart, sly comedy about what its director, Will Bakke, calls ""the power of platforms,"" ""Believe Me"" parodies the machinery of faith-based fund-raising with its heart on its sleeve and its jokes above the belt."

2830,m/below,Sara Michelle Fetters,Fresh,2003-06-19,"His Below is one of the scariest, most intense ghostly tales in a long time. Yet the ghost in question hardly lifts a finger and the unhinged human protagonists do most of the damage."
2831,m/below,Kirk Honeycutt,Rotten,2002-10-10,"A movie that plays like a gimmick, reliant upon one's appreciation of movie genres ranging from film noir to ghost stories rather than a tale that unfolds to its own rhythms and logic."

2842,m/beneath_the_darkness,Tim Grierson,Rotten,2012-01-03,Doesn't even have the pulse-pounding excitement of a second-tier Scooby-Doo mystery.

2847,m/beneath_the_darkness,Stephen Whitty,Rotten,2012-01-06,"The screenplay gets nothing out of the claustrophobic terror of being locked up in that narrow grave, and the ""mystery"" is obvious from the start."
2848,m/beneath_the_darkness,Mark Olsen,Rotten,2012-01-06,"At times it seems the simple ineptitude of ""Beneath the Darkness"" surely must mask some undercurrent of deeper sophistication and intention on behalf of the filmmakers. Alas, as it turns out, such things never surface."
2849,m/beneath_the_darkness,Neil Genzlinger,Rotten,2012-01-05,"Someone involved with ""Beneath the Darkness"" has either watched too many horror movies or not enough."
2850,m/beneath_the_darkness,Andrew Schenker,Rotten,2012-01-01,"Overly expository dialogue abounds, as do questionable filmmaking choices and plenty of stupidly unconvincing actions taken on the part of the film's characters."

2854,m/beneath_the_darkness,Marc Savlov,Rotten,2012-01-06,"When it comes to creepy old buildings, overly attentive owners, and prying outsiders, Beneath the Darkness has nada on Don Coscarelli's epic Phantasm saga or, for that matter, Norman Bates' clear-eyed if psychotic shenanigans."
2855,m/beneath_the_darkness,Joe Neumaier,Rotten,2012-01-05,"[Quaid] needs to resist hamming it up in Z-movies like ""Beneath the Darkness,"" which are beneath him and pretty much everyone else."
2856,m/beneath_the_darkness,John Anderson,Rotten,2012-01-05,"A malformed, would-be horror shocker with a deliriously deranged performance by Dennis Quaid, who unfortunately seems to be the only one onboard who thinks he's in a comedy."
2857,m/beneath_the_darkness,John DeFore,Rotten,2012-01-06,Dennis Quaid goes Psycho in dull Texas-set thriller.

2860,m/beneath_the_darkness,Edward Douglas,Rotten,2012-01-05,"Bruce Wilkinson, the film's late writer and executive producer, is more than likely turning in his own grave."
2861,m/benji_off_the_leash,Mary Lasse,Rotten,2006-11-01,"Lacks creativity. The first Benji was original, and each new sequel needs to be a new creation. Instead, we get the same Benji formula."
2862,m/benji_off_the_leash,Larry Ratliff,Rotten,2004-08-20,"This story is simplistic and budget-restrained at best. The script has little real mystery and no nuance. Frankly, the best acting comes from the canine co-stars."
2863,m/benji_off_the_leash,Roger Ebert,Fresh,2004-08-20,"Not one of the great dog movies, but it's a good one, abandoning wall-to-wall cuteness for a drama about a homeless puppy."
2864,m/benji_off_the_leash,Frank Swietek,Rotten,2004-08-18,"So long as Camp sticks to Benji and Shaggy, his movie is, like them, endearingly scruffy. Unfortunately, too much of the running-time is devoted to the people."
2865,m/benji_off_the_leash,Jeff Vice,Rotten,2004-08-20,"At times, it seems as if cast members are making this up as they go along. And Whitaker is a little stiff and awkward, especially when he's acting with the animals and is forced into the lead role."
2866,m/benji_off_the_leash,Claudia Puig,Rotten,2004-08-19,"It seems as if all the effort in the movie went toward making the pooches seem empathetic and emotional, but little thought went into making the human characters multidimensional."
2867,m/benji_off_the_leash,Steven D. Greydanus,Rotten,2004-08-18,"Thinks a happy ending is not for the boy to get to keep the dog, but for the dog to go to Hollywood the first family film [that ends with] the father getting arrested."

2872,m/benji_off_the_leash,Catherine Foster,Rotten,2004-08-20,"Camp's films are independently produced, use little-known actors, and there's a slightly amateurish quality to them. But Benji: Off the Leash! has a raggy charm, like the dogs, and a solid moral ending."
2873,m/benji_off_the_leash,Andy Klein,Fresh,2004-08-18,...almost impossible to resist.

2877,m/benji_off_the_leash,Randy Cordova,Rotten,2004-08-19,"Couldn't they find a dog that at least looked like the original? This bowser is fluffier than Benji ever was, and is mostly dingy white."

2893,m/betting_on_zero,Daphne Howland,Fresh,2017-03-15,The situation is heartbreaking and frustrating. But the film is so persuasive that it could help finally tank Herbalife's shares and validate Ackman's gamble - possibly preventing thousands of others.
2894,m/betting_on_zero,Kam Williams,Fresh,2017-03-16,"Is Herbalife a thinly-veiled con game being run by shady snake oil salesmen, or a benign operation affording average folks a realistic shot at the increasingly-elusive American Dream? You be the judge!"
2895,m/betting_on_zero,Ben Kenigsberg,Fresh,2017-03-16,"Mr. Ackman comes across as sincere in his outrage and cogent in his presentations. Even more valuable is the opportunity to meet and learn about Herbalife's purported victims, from Queens to Chicago to Oklahoma."

3198,m/blue_valentine,Mike Scott,Fresh,2011-01-31,"It's at its root a hard-to-resist character study. That's because the character being studied is you and me and everyone else who has ever fallen in, and out of, love"

3255,m/body_of_war,Beth Accomando,Fresh,2008-06-08,Body of War is a powerful and effective documentary because it keeps its focus very tight and makes its story vivid in personal terms.

3257,m/body_of_war,Robert W. Butler,Fresh,2008-03-07,"Equal parts sadness and inspiration, fury and compassion, the film is sure to divide audiences along ideological lines.

And just the way it was always meant to be."
3636,m/calvin_marshall,Michelle Orange,Fresh,2010-08-17,[Director] Lundgren has a light touch and a weakness for wistful indie lullabies; it is the former that gives this classic coming-of-age film its distinctive ring.

3649,m/candidate,Geoff Andrew,Fresh,2006-06-24,Ritchie and Redford's follow-up to Downhill Racer is one of the more intelligent films to have been made about political machinations in America.
3650,m/candidate,Emanuel Levy,Fresh,2007-01-17,"The first and arguably the sharpest expose of the new media-determined American political process, The Candidate offers producer-star Redford one of his strongest dramatic roles; Michael Ritchei's 1972 cautionary tale became prophetic in its message"
3651,m/candidate,John A. Nesbit,Fresh,2007-02-12,"Good early intro to the political machinery behind the candidates, where the emphasis is clearly only focused on winning"
3652,m/candidate,Variety Staff,Fresh,2008-06-03,"Redford's superior acting talents, which not-often-enough are tapped by the scripts he decides to do, are nearly all on display herein in a virtuoso peformance."
3653,m/candidate,Andrew Sarris,Rotten,2013-01-14,Redford fancies himself so superior to the electoral process that he ends up with a completely fatuous characterization of a politician.
3654,m/candidate,Jay Cocks,Rotten,2018-06-29,"Neither the authentic political atmosphere nor canny performances by Redford, Boyle and Porter go far to cut through the basic glibness of the film."
3655,m/candidate,Dave Kehr,Rotten,2018-06-29,Much of it has a pleasing air of accuracy. But Redford's inability to suggest any irony about himself finally sinks it -- it's the only sanctimonious satire you'll ever see.
3656,m/candidate,Kim Newman,Fresh,2018-06-29,"With Redford giving one of his best comedic performances, helped by a Oscar winning script, The Candidate is witty and charming, while looking good and proving quite memorable."
3657,m/candidate,Tom Hutchinson,Fresh,2018-06-29,"Robert Redford's engaging performance here breathes fresh life into the all-power-corrupts theme, and the sharply observed situations won an Oscar for scriptwriter Jeremy Larner."

3661,m/candidate,Tony Mastroianni,Rotten,2018-11-16,"It is full of political insights, of ironic humor. It shows an understanding of words that mean nothing. What the script lacks is definition of people as people. It stacks its deck. McKay is too charming, too nice, his rival too much a villain."

3671,m/candy,Jeff Vice,Rotten,2006-12-29,"Candy is pretty much the standard, downbeat, drug-addicts-in-love tale we've seen repeatedly over the years."
3672,m/candy,Rich Cline,Fresh,2006-11-15,"Harrowing and strongly moving, this junkie drama beautifully explores the emotional core of its characters. It helps, of course, that the cast is this good."
3673,m/candy,Jan Stuart,Fresh,2006-11-16,"If the characters' trajectory feels pre-ordained, the actors force us to sit up and pay attention with renewed focus."
3674,m/candy,Kaleem Aftab,Rotten,2018-11-03,"There is nothing harder to do well on screen than a picaresque drama about drug addiction... Despite good performances and excellent cinematography, this is a struggle that the filmmaker loses."
3675,m/candy,Eric Lurio,Fresh,2006-11-18,This may be a good film to take the kiddies to if you want to scare them. Sort of like those car crash films in driver's ed. But it's generally not worth it.

3677,m/candy,Andrew Wright,Rotten,2006-12-07,"Doesn't deviate much from the downward-spiral norm, but benefits hugely from an atypically loose performance by Heath Ledger."
3678,m/candy,Wesley Morris,Fresh,2006-12-01,It's one thing for a movie to show us the perils of addiction. It's another for it to give us two people who can't seem to find any joy in it.

3697,m/captain_phillips,Matt Neal,Fresh,2013-10-24,An edge-of-your-seat cat-and-mouse game for much of its running time.
3698,m/captain_phillips,Simon Miraudo,Fresh,2013-10-21,"This antagonistic yet somehow respectuful relationship between the two skippers gives Captain Phillips its twist: we knew to expect a white-knuckle cinematic experience from this director, but not such a uniquely challenging relationship drama too."

3703,m/captain_phillips,Edward Lawrenson,Fresh,2016-06-08,It's a brilliantly accomplished hostage drama -- claustrophobic and breathlessly paced -- and Greengrass' commanding piloting of a Hollywood juggernaut can blind you to the film's faults.
3704,m/captain_phillips,Jason Bailey,Fresh,2016-06-19,"It seems strange to say that an actor as awarded and acclaimed as Tom Hanks is still capable of surprising us. But he does in 'Captain Phillips,' which is one of the best films of the year."
3705,m/captain_phillips,Bill Newcott,Fresh,2016-04-18,Great movies nearly always involve a director's galvanizing vision and an actor's willingness to let character drive performance. Captain Phillips is a great movie.

3710,m/captain_phillips,Steve Persall,Fresh,2013-10-18,"The movie plays as verite' as scripted cinema can... It's a shame of sorts that such a celebrity as Tom Hanks plays the title role, sticking out among mostly unknown faces, reminding us that what often appears real isn't documentary."
3711,m/captivity,Jeannette Catsoulis,Rotten,2007-07-14,Captivity the movie has been thoroughly eclipsed by Captivity the marketing.

3713,m/captivity,Paul Arendt,Rotten,2007-06-22,"Joffe and his screenwriter Larry Cohen deserve a little credit for pointing up the psychological horrors where they can, but Captivity is still a grubby, exploitative film with an extremely guessable twist and universally dull performances."
3714,m/captivity,Marc Savlov,Rotten,2007-07-20,Captivity is the kind of film that gives torture porn a bad name. It's disturbing in the most unpleasant ways possible outside of Abu Ghraib or battlefield snuff films.
3715,m/captivity,Ali Gray,Fresh,2012-11-03,"There's something about Captivity that'll keep you watching; it could be your morbid curiosity, perhaps it's a sick bloodlust, or maybe, just maybe, it's because Elisha Cuthbert is clad in a low-cut dress at all times. My money's on all three."
3716,m/captivity,Ty Burr,Rotten,2007-07-14,"It's a Saw rip-off with less smarts. (Take a moment, please, to allow that sentence to sink in.)"

3724,m/captivity,Mike Barnard,Rotten,2007-07-13,"As a horror/thriller trying to add another dimension to what has gone before in countless low budget American incarnations, Captivity feels like a cop out given its promising beginnings."
3725,m/captivity,Rich Cline,Rotten,2007-06-28,"Polished and atmospheric, but utterly vacuous."

3727,m/captivity,Larry Ratliff,Rotten,2007-07-16,"With the exception of ramming my head into a brick wall, then backing up and repeating the exercise, I can't think of anything I'd rather not be doing on a Friday afternoon."
3728,m/captivity,Kaleem Aftab,Rotten,2018-11-03,The current plight of Paris Hilton makes you suspect that the heiress' jail sentence is an elaborate marketing ploy for Captivity. If only the once great director Roland Joffe and writer Larry Cohen behind Captivity could show such imagination.
3729,m/captivity,Urban Cinefile Critics,Rotten,2008-05-01,"Without even calling into question the morals of a film which seems to exist only to depict the suffering of multiple women through hideous tortures, the film is still an empty mess, offering only a minor afterthought of an explanation to who is doing the"
3730,m/captivity,Tim Robey,Rotten,2007-06-22,"Captivity is an abomination, and perhaps a new low in the torture-porn genre: a film I liked even less than Hostel."
3731,m/career_opportunities,Chris Hicks,Rotten,2000-01-01,"Aside from the interminable music videos, set to a constant, very loud Top-40 soundtrack, much of the film is so surrealistic and weird that you may think certain scenes are meant to be of daydreams."

3744,m/carrie,Ray Pride,Fresh,2014-04-05,Peirce's imagery is pungent: the mark of Carrie's bloody palm print on the eggshell blue of her gym teacher's skirt; a slow-motion whirling sateen dervish of a student and her gown in flames.

3754,m/carrie,Steve Newton,Rotten,2013-10-18,By the time the pig's blood has splattered (three times) and Carrie has wreaked her awkward destruction (sprinklers set off before the fire?) you'll be convinced that the new Carrie is average at best.
3755,m/carrie,Nathan Rabin,Rotten,2013-10-17,"Carrie travels a predictable, distressingly straight line...hitting all the expected notes along the way diligently, but with little inspiration."
3756,m/carrie,Brian Orndorf,Rotten,2013-10-17,"Playing it safe to appeal to a generation that hasn't been exposed to this tale of telekinetic woe, the new Carrie is much like the old Carrie, only now the mayhem is more hard drive-based than wonderfully, inventively practical."

3762,m/casual_sex,Jonathan Rosenbaum,Fresh,2000-01-01,"Definitely a lightweight movie, without any heavy ambitions, but for the most part a likable one; with script and direction by women, it's considerably less arch and dehumanized than the usual sex comedy."
3763,m/casual_sex,Janet Maslin,Rotten,2003-05-20,"Aside from these confessional flourishes and the very infrequent bright remark (''It was the early 80's, and sex was still a good way to meet new people''), the film is as ordinary as it can be."
3764,m/casual_sex,Tom Charity,Fresh,2006-06-24,"After a variety of sketchy farcical/romantic complications, the movie settles for a rather sentimental epilogue, but it remains surprisingly engaging."

3766,m/casual_sex,Jack Garner,Rotten,2020-04-15,"Casual Sex? is a casual mess. It's casual in that it is shallow, uninvolving, superficial and leaves no lasting impression, and a mess in that it's ... a mess."
3767,m/casual_sex,Michael Wilmington,Rotten,2020-04-15,"If the script is dubious, the direction matches it. The cast is less directed than exploited."
3768,m/casual_sex,People Staff,Rotten,2020-04-15,"Only the ""Vin Man,"" a beast from the East named Vinny and played as a macho send-up by comic Andrew Dice Clay, lightens up the proceedings."
3769,m/casual_sex,Variety Staff,Fresh,2020-04-15,"With the late 1980s sensibility, their sex conversations are peppered with the girls' finding their own identities in relationships with men outside the sex act. Is it mature? Yes. Is it funny? No."

3771,m/cat_run,Michelle Orange,Rotten,2011-03-29,"Director John Stockwell uses split screens, a blaxploitation soundtrack, and hammy, Get Smart sound effects to put some old-school spring in Cat Run's step. It makes for an odd combination with the film's ecstatic, viscera-laden violence."
3772,m/cat_run,Brian Orndorf,Rotten,2011-03-30,"Bullets, babes, perverts, Euro travel, secret documents, hitmen, car bombs, and testicular torture. Oh my."
3773,m/cat_run,Todd McCarthy,Rotten,2011-03-30,"A brazenly efficient and articulate female assassin nearly worthy of a Tarantino or Coen Brothers movie sticks out from amidst the schlocky criminal muck of Cat Run, a self-consciously sleazy comic crime saga composed of facetious elements."
3774,m/cat_run,Mark R. Leeper,Fresh,2011-03-30,"Made for today it just is more chaotic, has more nudity, and had more violence including some slightly nauseating scenes of torture. Otherwise the film is funny and fun, a fast, entertaining ride."

3777,m/cat_run,Scott Tobias,Rotten,2011-03-31,"Words like ""smug,"" ""derivative,"" and ""shallow"" could all be fairly applied to the film, but as a piece of late-night exploitation, it delivers the violence and nudity with the regularity of an IV drip, and some familiar faces in the cast help class it up."
3778,m/cat_run,Elizabeth Weitzman,Fresh,2011-04-01,"Though John Stockwell's action comedy is shamelessly derivative, his enthusiastic cast propels it much further than it should go."
3779,m/cat_run,Mark Keizer,Rotten,2011-04-04,"A loud, ugly and terrible movie that doesn't skillfully juggle its various elements; it throws them violently at your face and calls it edge."
3780,m/cat_run,Mark Olsen,Rotten,2011-04-04,"It's easy to feel sucked into some kind of time warp back to the heyday of late-'90s post-Tarantino crime thrillers, cut-rate knockoffs filled with casually cartoonish violence, quippy patter, overtly flash filmmaking and incongruous pop tunes."
3781,m/cat_run,Jesse Cataldo,Rotten,2011-04-04,The nicest thing to be said about Cat Run might be that it doesn't know what kind of movie it wants to become.
3782,m/cat_run,John Anderson,Rotten,2011-04-04,"If you can't dazzle 'em with brilliance, baffle 'em with genre baloney -- and enough shoplifted visual trickery to fill Quentin Tarantino's kitchen sink."

3792,m/catch_a_fire,Bill Zwecker,Fresh,2006-10-27,"Having first burst on the scene in his groundbreaking title role in Antwone Fisher, Luke delivers here a top-notch performance that is nuanced and layered, with just the right emotional punch."
3793,m/catch_a_fire,Ella Taylor,Fresh,2006-10-26,"As out-of-Africa dramas go these days, Catch a Fire is downright old-fashioned, a liberal political thriller about a noble black man who stands up to a white imperial monster."
3794,m/catch_a_fire,Chris Hewitt,Fresh,2006-10-26,"Director Phillip Noyce has crafted a powerful portrait of a people, their love of their land and their struggle to be free."

3799,m/catch_a_fire,Willie Waffle,Fresh,2006-10-26,"Luke has grown as an actor to have the same kind of screen presence as Matt Damon. If he keeps putting in performances like this, we'll upgrade him to Leonardo DiCaprio status."
3800,m/catch_a_fire,Tim Cogshell,Fresh,2006-10-29,"Timely in theme, Catch a Fire resonates because it is about an issue from a time not so long ago -- apartheid ended in 1991 -- with which we can still identify."
3801,m/catch_a_fire,Nell Minow,Fresh,2006-10-26,"A sizzling performance by Derek Luke ignites this story about Patrick Chamusso, a South African oil refinery worker who became caught up in the fight against apartheid."
3802,m/catch_a_fire,Jordan Hiller,Rotten,2006-12-31,The danger with films like Catch a Fire is that it wields the past purposefully as propaganda without tipping off the audience.
3803,m/catch_a_fire,Gabe Leibowitz,Rotten,2009-09-19,Movies like Catch a Fire are perhaps the most banal sort to write about.
3804,m/catch_a_fire,Stephanie Zacharek,Rotten,2006-10-26,"Ultimately, [director Phillip Noyce] does a pretty good job of telling us the cost of freedom; he just can't quite put us inside the skin of the people who had to pay it."

3808,m/catchfire,Adam Lippe,Fresh,2011-09-30,"Foster's scenes where she is utterly surprised by Hopper's lack of knowledge of the world, are so inviting without being condescending, eerily reminiscent of how she responded to De Niro in Taxi Driver."

3810,m/catfight_2017,Stefan Pape,Fresh,2017-03-10,"A picture that blends its irreverence with a satirical undercurrent that enriches the narrative, making for a film that is irrepressibly entertaining - and yet is complete with a rather pointed socio-political message."
3811,m/catfight_2017,Tim Evans,Fresh,2017-03-09,It's a highly enjoyable experience to watch these cats' fur really fly.
3812,m/catfight_2017,Matthew Bond,Rotten,2017-10-16,"There may be some fiendishly clever satire at work here, but the violence is so protracted and unpleasant, and the end result so lacking in laughs, that I soon gave up trying to find it."

3814,m/catfight_2017,Jeannette Catsoulis,Fresh,2017-03-02,"Drawing its energy from revenge and its jagged humor from a black well of contempt for the wealthy, the movie fashions a world in which the only likable characters are the crazy and the doomed."
3815,m/catfight_2017,David Parkinson,Fresh,2017-03-10,"Played with committed ferocity by the excellent Oh and Heche, this riotous state-of-the-nation satire may lack subtlety, but it has the courage of its socko convictions and certainly packs a punch."
3816,m/catfight_2017,Sheila O'Malley,Fresh,2017-03-03,"Catfight is not the story of two gals who hate each other and then realize, over appletinis, how much they have in common. Tukel takes that tired clich and blows it to smithereens."
3817,m/catfight_2017,Mark Dujsik,Rotten,2017-03-03,"As a joke, Catfight is a punch line with a really shaky setup."
3818,m/catfight_2017,Glenn Dunks,Fresh,2017-03-04,"This film positions Ashley and Veronica as symbols of America, angry and resentful to the point of absurdity. The film is red-raw in its antagonism to modern culture."
3819,m/catfight_2017,Ray Pride,Fresh,2017-03-03,"Onur Tukel's proudly ragged, black-and-black comedies lean gleefully toward interpersonal savageries, and the compelling fisticuffs of the presciently Trumpian Catfight ... is no exception"

3823,m/catfight_2017,Jared Mobarak,Fresh,2016-09-27,"Our expectations are forced into conjuring hope for a wild, frenzied ride. Onur Tukel doesn't disappoint with this broad satire of American politics and wealth disparity."
3824,m/catfight_2017,Ed Potton,Rotten,2017-03-10,Veronica is the trophy wife of a reptilian businessman. Ashley is a struggling artist who paints pictures of decapitated sperm. Both are vile.
3825,m/catfight_2017,Jordan Hoffman,Fresh,2016-09-12,"The absurdist use of fisticuffs in Onur Tukel's extremely independent Catfight is unnerving, strangely hilarious -- and, whether you accept it or not, meaningful."

3839,m/catfish,Lisa Kennedy,Fresh,2010-09-24,"At the end of this exquisitely poignant film, it's clear we humans are going to need a refreshed emotional skill set if we're to make sense of the real relationships we forge in our virtual worlds."

3841,m/catfish,Matthew Turner,Fresh,2010-10-26,"Impressively directed and superbly edited, this is an utterly riveting documentary that is by turns suspenseful, hilarious, disturbing and moving."
3842,m/catfish,Philip Concannon,Fresh,2010-12-02,"Catfish will leave you with plenty of nagging questions, but whatever the truth behind the story, this is an extraordinary, provocative film and one that grips like a vice right up to the troubling and moving finale."

3845,m/catfish,Phil Hall,Rotten,2011-01-04,"The core story might be legitimate, but too much of the film is so blatantly staged that it is impossible to imagine this is a genuine record of life unfolding."
3846,m/catfish,Matthew Toomey,Fresh,2011-01-27,I applaud the makers of Catfish for the way in which they've made and marketed their movie. They're selling it as something different... and that's a big reason why I liked it.
3847,m/catfish,Geoff Berkshire,Fresh,2010-09-15,"Even as a work of fiction, Catfish would remain provocative and true."
3848,m/catfish,JimmyO,Fresh,2010-09-13,"Catfish is heartbreaking, funny and not necessarily what you'd expect."

3855,m/cautiva,Jan Stuart,Fresh,2006-11-09,"The debut feature of Gastn Biraben, Cautiva is most potent in its first hour, as it bears witness to the disorientation and distrust experienced by a young girl whose life is suddenly turned upside down."
3856,m/cautiva,V.A. Musetto,Fresh,2006-11-10,The Argentine thriller Cautiva features a solid performance by 23-year-old Barbara Lombardo that goes a long way in making up for the telenovela script.
3857,m/cautiva,Ernest Hardy,Fresh,2006-11-23,"Neither Biraben's script nor his direction leave room for doubt as to how he feels about the nightmarish past, but he's smart enough to know that even justified outrage sometimes has to be tempered with the complexities of human intentions and realities."
3858,m/cautiva,Sam Adams,Rotten,2006-11-24,"If Biraben had devoted more energy to the human contours of his story, its metaphorical implications would have sorted themselves out."

3885,m/cbgb,Matt Donato,Rotten,2013-10-07,"CBGB is like a cheap cover band - sure, you'll get some entertainment, but the experience is missing that original spark of life."
3886,m/cbgb,Christy Lemire,Rotten,2013-10-11,"""CBGB"" ain't no party, it ain't no disco, it ain't no foolin' around."
3887,m/cbgb,Nora Lee Mandel,Rotten,2013-10-13,Warm gloss of nostalgia over the rise of the punk music scene in gritty 1970's downtown New York. The spirit of musical and visual energy outweighs fanciful superficiality.
3888,m/cbgb,Tomas Hachard,Rotten,2013-10-08,"As the film moves from one musical performance to another, the result increasingly feels like a series of celebrity impersonations set to a best-of-punk compilation album."
3889,m/cbgb,Brent Simon,Rotten,2013-10-08,"Yet another film from Miller, starring Rickman, with an engaging protagonist and an interesting backdrop or pitch, but little sense of psychological depth."
3890,m/cbgb,Forrest Cardamenis,Rotten,2016-06-22,"With nonexistent character depth, abysmal storytelling, and an aesthetic gimmick that hurts the film far more than it helps, all CBGB only benefits from a killer soundtrack."
3891,m/cbgb,Stephen Whitty,Rotten,2013-10-11,"If you really want to remember those times? Get out ""Horses."" Or ""Talking Heads: 77."" Or ""Blank Generation."" Preferably on vinyl, with all the pops and scratches. And play them. Loud."
3892,m/cbgb,Eric Hynes,Rotten,2013-10-08,"Mythologizing by way of whip-pans and slapstick spit-takes, CBGB just might be the CBGB that we deserve."
3893,m/cbgb,Travis Hopson,Rotten,2013-09-12,"There's very little rockin' goin' on at the CBGB, and those unfamiliar with it will wonder what the fuss is all about."
3894,m/cbgb,Todd Jorgenson,Rotten,2013-10-18,"The film has energy to spare, but the comic-book visual style is heavy-handed and the film merely skims the surface of the club's influence on the pop-culture landscape."
3895,m/cbgb,Brian McManus,Rotten,2013-10-07,"CBGB misses the opportunity to educate. But its biggest sin, unlike many who performed there, is that it also misses the opportunity to entertain."
3896,m/cbgb,Tomris Laffly,Rotten,2013-10-11,"CBGB generally feels like a misstep, with self-aware characters all stuck in a movie that can't decide what it wants to be stylistically."
3897,m/cbgb,Abbie Bernstein,Fresh,2019-01-25,"It's fun, affectionate and certainly tuneful, but it doesn't get under anyone's skin."
3898,m/cbgb,Nicholas Bell,Rotten,2019-08-29,"Moments of nostalgic emotion are ever so briefly reached, and evaporate so quickly that your only desire will be to listen to the actual music of the cavalcade of artists paraded across the screen."
3899,m/cbgb,Todd Gilchrist,Rotten,2013-10-11,"a moderately effective overview of the club's early years, distilled into sitcom-worthy vignettes without the kind of recklessness to make them seem truly dangerous, CBGB is the pop-punk version of a raucous, punk-rock story."
3900,m/cbgb,Mark Jenkins,Fresh,2013-10-10,This is not a film for purists or quibblers.
3901,m/cbgb,Judy Berman,Rotten,2017-09-21,"Unless you're morbidly curious about how one of the loudest, strangest, and most irreverent and original moments in rock history can be transformed into a jukebox musical for the entertainment of precisely no one, there's no need to see CBGB."
3902,m/centurion,Brian Orndorf,Fresh,2010-08-04,"The filmmaker floods the film with blood and growls, creating a mighty clang of history and gore. It's Herschell Gordon Lewis's I, Claudius."
3903,m/centurion,Nick Schager,Rotten,2010-08-23,"Though seemingly content to be a B-movie director, Neil Marshall heads further into C-list territory with Centurion"

3905,m/centurion,Alistair Harkness,Fresh,2010-04-26,"While some of the blood-spilling action scenes could have benefited from a little more dramatic shaping, it's a mostly satisfying effort."
3906,m/centurion,Sean Axmaker,Rotten,2010-06-05,"The men get lost in the muddy palette of earth tones... and the staccato strobe-vision of battle scenes that simply confuses the action, and the story along with it."
3907,m/centurion,Alan Jones,Rotten,2010-04-22,"Though it's technically impressive and has an epic sweep, the lack of suspense and emotional involvement makes this little more than a chase movie in ancient garb."
3908,m/centurion,Christian Toto,Fresh,2010-09-03,Centurion is like 'Gladiator' directed by Freddy Krueger
3909,m/centurion,Kelly Vance,Rotten,2010-08-25,"Questions arise. When exactly was eye makeup invented? Why do screenwriters still, after Life of Brian, give Roman characters names like Virilus?"
3910,m/centurion,Betsy Sharkey,Fresh,2010-08-26,"By turns heroic, fearsome, funny, fateful and, oh, so brutal, with swords hacking off heads at every turn."
3911,m/centurion,Stella Papamichael,Rotten,2010-04-22,"Soon, the action begins to feel monotonous and Marshall's answer is to pick off more victims..."
3912,m/centurion,Wesley Morris,Rotten,2010-08-26,"Flaming arrows, spears, and knives have no problem finding their way to the back of a mouth. The profanity is delightful. And the general atmosphere is grim. The movie just isn't terribly inspired."

3914,m/centurion,David Nusair,Fresh,2018-06-20,"It's clear almost immediately that Centurion's biggest assets are its various performances and visceral, violent sensibilities..."
3915,m/centurion,Jordan Hoffman,Fresh,2010-08-27,Centurion treats arterial sprays like Sex and the City treats shoes.
3916,m/centurion,Andrea Chase,Rotten,2010-08-26,mixes a thoroughly honorable high-mindedness with frequent and jarring examples of torture porn
3917,m/centurion,Matt Prigge,Fresh,2010-08-27,"Even for the seasoned gorehound, Marshall's films hack off body parts you've never seen hacked off before -- or ever thought you'd want to."
3918,m/centurion,Jeff Bayer,Rotten,2010-09-12,It's a cat and mouse game where we are stuck rooting for the cat even though it killed and raped thousands of mice.
3919,m/centurion,Debbie Lynn Elias,Fresh,2019-11-07,Riveting. Pulsating. An action-packed Roman thrill ride from start to finish.
3920,m/centurion,Coco Forsythe,Fresh,2010-04-28,"Marshall has cast a dream team of character actors and upcoming stars as supporting roles; the cameraderie and banter between the men is realistic, funny and rude."
3921,m/centurion,Geoff Berkshire,Fresh,2010-08-26,"There are beheadings, slit throats and eviscerations aplenty, but Marshall's real distinction is in the way he crafts a brawny action film without losing his own head in the process."
3922,m/certain_women_2016,Aubrey Page,Fresh,2016-10-04,"Reichardt has spun another breathtaking ode to life, and to the female experience, with easy humor and most of all, tenderness, that makes the phrase ""Certain Women"" one of rarified honor."
3923,m/certain_women_2016,Fred Topel,Fresh,2016-01-27,"Small town stories that remind us that everything is important to the people experiencing them, and there is drama everywhere you look if you pay attention."
3924,m/certain_women_2016,Alberto Sáez Villarino,Fresh,2016-11-10,"A piece of great syntactic complexity, where aesthetics is based on the masterful use of language and stylistic, rhythmic and euphonic resources. [Full review in Spanish]"
3925,m/certain_women_2016,Ryan Gilbey,Fresh,2017-03-02,"This is an undemonstrative picture, richer in detail than incident, and ever-so-slightly wholegrain and dull."
3926,m/certain_women_2016,Pat Padua,Fresh,2018-08-29,The world of emotions that play across Gladstone as Jamie starts the long drive home is heartbreaking.
3927,m/certain_women_2016,Mae Abdulbaki,Rotten,2018-08-22,"Besides Gladstone's performance, ""Certain Women"" doesn't have anything going for it that would make it memorable."
3928,m/certain_women_2016,Leslie Felperin,Fresh,2017-03-02,"If the characters here are often sparing with their words, or even withholding, the visuals speak volumes."
3929,m/certain_women_2016,Michael Smith,Rotten,2016-11-03,"It's difficult to grade a film when the subject matter, and the subjects, feel so incomplete."
3930,m/certain_women_2016,Tina Hassannia,Fresh,2017-05-19,"While Certain Women is focused somewhat on the nuance of dialogue and its intertwining with body language, it's a deliberately quiet and reserved little film."
3931,m/certain_women_2016,Nigel M. Smith,Fresh,2016-01-25,"Like Reichardt's directorial hand, the performances are understated across the board, but deeply felt."
3932,m/certain_women_2016,Mick LaSalle,Rotten,2016-10-19,A movie in which it becomes very possible to respect the intent and yet be frustrated by the result.
3933,m/certain_women_2016,Kate Muir,Fresh,2017-03-02,Kelly Reichardt elicits every nuance from her small-town characters and leaves the viewer on the verge of reading their minds.
3934,m/certain_women_2016,Michael Arbeiter,Fresh,2016-10-11,"With so much on its mind, it's this devotion to mood that keeps Certain Women as satisfyingly visceral as it is excitingly cerebral, and as flavorfully classical as it is tastefully new."
3935,m/certain_women_2016,Dana Stevens,Fresh,2016-10-13,"Even as the four protagonists struggle, often in vain, to get someone else to pay attention, Reichardt's camera is right there, watching and listening."
3936,m/certain_women_2016,Stephen Saito,Fresh,2018-11-19,"Reichardt doesn't have the same narrative conventions to fall back on, but like the women she follows with her camera, she forges her own path and in doing so, comes up with something bewitching."
3937,m/certain_women_2016,Noah Gittell,Fresh,2016-10-20,Some movies punch you in the gut. Others barely graze the skin but gnaw at you long after they finish. Certain Women is the second kind.
3938,m/certain_women_2016,Katherine McLaughlin,Fresh,2017-02-27,"A tender, meaty and startlingly beautiful portrait of the American Northwest and the trailblazing women that toil fearlessly against its rocky terrain."
3939,m/certain_women_2016,Stephen Whitty,Fresh,2016-10-10,"Director Kelly Reichardt, who made the great ""Wendy and Lucy,"" likes stories that unfold slowly and simply. Sometimes she'll just let the camera run, making us watch the awkwardness of people who can't connect."
3940,m/certain_women_2016,Jaime N. Christley,Fresh,2016-09-28,The threat of feeling slighted links every small and large ripple of drama in Kelly Reichardt's film.
3941,m/certain_women_2016,Oliver Whitney,Fresh,2016-08-04,The type of work that requires patience for the quiet intersections and confrontations of simple lives.

3944,m/chaplin,Roger Moore,Rotten,2020-04-23,"The decades haven't erased the sense that ""the longer it goes on, the worse it gets."""
3945,m/chaplin,Desson Thomson,Rotten,2000-01-01,The movie indulges in a rather stale flashback procedure.
3946,m/chaplin,Jeffrey M. Anderson,Fresh,2008-10-16,"The movie was clearly made with a lot of love, and it has one deciding factor that sells it: Robert Downey Jr."
3947,m/chaplin,John A. Nesbit,Fresh,2007-02-05,Robert Downey enhales Chaplin's Autobiography and wears the Little Tramp's persona effectively
3948,m/chaplin,Jeffrey M. Anderson,Fresh,2003-01-10,Robert Downey Jr. is brilliant in this guilty pleasure.
3949,m/chaplin,Christopher Null,Fresh,2008-12-04,"It's a loving and often endearing homage to a man, but as with all things Hollywood, it ain't history"
3950,m/chaplin,Chris Hicks,Fresh,2000-01-01,Downey's surprisingly dead-on impersonation of Chaplin is an absolute knockout and well worth the price of admission.
3951,m/chaplin,Anthony Lane,Fresh,2018-01-03,"Downey has a perfect ear for the Chaplin accent, the way it climbed from Cockney to minced posh, and a perfect boot and fist for the slapstick; the one thing he doesn't have is an eye on his own brilliance."
3952,m/chaplin,Jonathan Rosenbaum,Rotten,2008-02-27,"A lot of loving care (but not much thought) went into this white elephant, and considering how fascinating a figure Chaplin is it's never exactly boring, but your time would be much better spent looking at any of Chaplin's pictures."
3953,m/chaplin,Rita Kempley,Rotten,2000-01-01,It's a monumental biopic that cheapens the hero's successes by glossing over the failures that surely also shaped the man.
3954,m/chaplin,Vanessa Letts,Fresh,2018-07-24,"What is stunningly good about Chaplin, despite the script, is the central performance by Robert Downey Jr."
3955,m/chaplin,Michael A. Smith,Fresh,2005-04-22,Great bio-pic with Downey at his best.
3956,m/chaplin,Luis Martinez,Fresh,2002-09-19,An awsome Robert Downey. Excelent performance!
3957,m/chaplin,Roger Ebert,Rotten,2000-01-01,"This is a disappointing, misguided movie that has all of the parts in place to be a much better one."
3958,m/chaplin,Dan Fienberg,Fresh,2005-10-21,"Actually, it's a pretty bad movie, but Robert Downey Jr. is so great that you can forget nearly all of the clunky storytelling."
3959,m/chaplin,Malcolm Johnson,Fresh,2018-05-02,"Robert Downey, Jr.'s performance in extreme youth and decrepitude carries Attenborough's vainglorious project through scene after sketchy scene."
3960,m/chaplin,Robert Roten,Fresh,2002-10-28,Great performance by Downey.
3961,m/chaplin,Scott Nash,Rotten,2012-09-25,"Might be of interest to fans of the great comic, but as entertainment it ultimately fails."
3962,m/chasers,Scott Weinberg,Rotten,2002-07-26,Fairly desperate military comedy.
3963,m/chelsea_walls,Jeffrey Bruner,Rotten,2002-06-06,"Hawke's film, a boring, pretentious waste of nearly two hours, doesn't tell you anything except that the Chelsea Hotel today is populated by whiny, pathetic, starving and untalented artistes."
3964,m/chelsea_walls,Mick LaSalle,Rotten,2002-05-10,"Hampered -- no, paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script ... that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire."
3965,m/chelsea_walls,John Hartl,Rotten,2002-05-17,The movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors' moments.
3966,m/chelsea_walls,Harvey S. Karten,Rotten,2002-04-18,"Deadly dull, pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel."
3967,m/chelsea_walls,Rob Blackwelder,Fresh,2002-05-13,It is a film in which body language and unspoken human intercourse play a much more important role than dialogue.
3968,m/chelsea_walls,Andy Klein,Rotten,2002-04-18,"With virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on, Chelsea Walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge."
3969,m/chelsea_walls,Stephen Holden,Rotten,2002-04-18,"If Chelsea Walls builds a mood of boozy poetic disorientation, a crucial ingredient is missing: the scent of genuine artistic genius."
3970,m/chelsea_walls,Robert Roten,Fresh,2003-01-09,"This is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker, but good actors, good poetry and good music help sustain it."
3971,m/chelsea_walls,Roger Ebert,Fresh,2002-06-07,Movies like this do not grab you by the throat. You have to be receptive.
3972,m/chelsea_walls,Maitland McDonagh,Rotten,2002-04-18,It's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish.
3973,m/chelsea_walls,Ed Gonzalez,Rotten,2002-04-11,Ethan Hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the Beatnik generation and it's all over his Chelsea Walls.
3974,m/chelsea_walls,John A. Nesbit,Rotten,2011-10-09,"Linklater fans, or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this"

3976,m/chelsea_walls,Jeffrey M. Anderson,Rotten,2002-05-10,Reeks with phony posturing and lot of talking without really saying anything.
3977,m/chelsea_walls,David Nusair,Rotten,2011-05-21,...a disastrously ill-conceived drama...
3978,m/chelsea_walls,Frank Swietek,Rotten,2002-05-20,"A dreary, incoherent, self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours...a cacophony of pretentious, meaningless prattle."
3979,m/chelsea_walls,Andrew O'Hehir,Rotten,2002-04-25,"I'm not suggesting that you actually see it, unless you're the kind of person who has seen every Wim Wenders film of the '70s."
3980,m/chelsea_walls,Jan Stuart,Rotten,2002-04-19,Like the Chelsea's denizens ... Burdette's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste.
3981,m/chelsea_walls,Josh Ralske,Rotten,2003-02-02,The film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other.
3982,m/chelsea_walls,Michael Dequina,Rotten,2002-04-24,"As is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions, the film is less poetic than simply pretentious."
3983,m/chi_raq,Jason Best,Rotten,2016-12-06,"There's genuine outrage behind Lee's angry blast of hip-hop agitprop, and his fury has good cause... Unfortunately, his film is also a gaudy mess."

3985,m/chi_raq,John Serba,Fresh,2015-12-12,"If there's a hot-button modern American issue to be pressed, Lee jabs it. The common thread is vitality, energy and urgency."

3987,m/chi_raq,Ryan Gilbey,Fresh,2016-12-01,"[Chi-Raq], if often muddled, is rarely dull."
3988,m/chi_raq,Robert Horton,Rotten,2015-12-04,"Lee is really letting it rip here. And although in a variety of ways Chi-Raq is overbearing and stilted, the thing is so unusual you can't help keeping your eyes glued to the screen."
3989,m/chi_raq,Kevin B. Lee,Fresh,2015-11-23,"In ""Chi-raq,"" Lee mixes fierce agitprop with lyrical musical numbers and Greek-inspired sex farce in hip hop verse. It's a mad combination that fittingly addresses a world of madness."
3990,m/chi_raq,Nell Minow,Fresh,2015-12-04,It is more than a film; it is an anguished wail of grief and fury and the most important film of 2015.
3991,m/chi_raq,Matt Zoller Seitz,Fresh,2015-12-02,"The job of a movie like this one is to stimulate arguments and hook itself into the viewer's imagination, and ""Chi-Raq"" accomplishes that job brilliantly."
3992,m/chi_raq,Elias Savada,Fresh,2015-12-21,"Lee, who birthed such memorable films asShe's Gotta Have It(1986) and School Daze(1988), is back at the top of his form withChi-Raq. Let's hope he stays there."
3993,m/chi_raq,Alissa Wilkinson,Fresh,2016-04-13,"Chi-Raq is raucous and transgressive, but most of all, it's a lament. And lament is exactly what we-you and I-need to learn: right now, this year, this month, this week, today."
3994,m/chi_raq,Lisa Rosman,Fresh,2017-07-25,"A wild-eyed, bumpily syncopated symphony in purple and gold, Chi-Raq is ragged and binary, for sure. It also is colorful in every way that our culture needs right now."
3995,m/chi_raq,Tim Brennan,Fresh,2020-02-13,It's not Spike Lee's job to come up with solutions. His job is to engage our imaginations and stimulate our minds. It's up to us to be smart enough and strong enough to solve these problems.

3997,m/chi_raq,Stephen Whitty,Fresh,2015-12-02,"At its best, it's sexy and surprising. At its worst, it's preaching to the choir - literally. And it's a sermon we've heard before."

4003,m/chicken_run,Rob Gonsalves,Fresh,2007-08-13,"Park's love for all his characters, good and evil, is literally palpable: These characters have been forged of clay, fussed over, posed, photographed over a period of years."

4026,m/children_of_huang_shi,Geoff Berkshire,Rotten,2008-05-22,Such an old school bore that you'll be tempted to wonder if it's actually satire played inexplicably straight.
4027,m/children_of_huang_shi,Sean Axmaker,Fresh,2008-06-29,"... an affecting portrait and a strong story with a compelling backdrop, and Chinese cinematographer Xiaoding Zhao makes the gorgeous locations look magnificent."
4028,m/children_of_huang_shi,Andrea Gronvall,Rotten,2008-06-06,"Director Roger Spottiswoode uses the children and action sequences to good effect, but a lack of chemistry between Rhys Meyers and Mitchell makes the love story fizzle."
4029,m/children_of_huang_shi,Cynthia Fuchs,Rotten,2008-05-31,"With all the stories to be told about the war between Japan and China, it's hard to believe that this one was the most compelling or most in need of telling."
4030,m/children_of_huang_shi,Roger Ebert,Rotten,2008-06-06,"Tells an engrossing story of a remarkable man, but nevertheless it's underwhelming."
4031,m/children_of_huang_shi,Austin Kennedy,Rotten,2008-06-15,What should be a moving story is ruined by hideous acting and sloppy filmmaking.
4032,m/children_of_huang_shi,Sandy MacDonald,Rotten,2008-05-30,"In alternating between an epic remove and a pro forma romance, The Children of Huang Shi stints on the messy middle ground, where the unscripted human element resides."
4033,m/children_of_huang_shi,David N. Butterworth,Rotten,2008-06-12,A dull dramatization of -- and ill-fitting testament to -- British journalist George Hogg's experiences in war torn China.
4034,m/children_of_huang_shi,Todd Gilchrist,Rotten,2009-02-13,...the film falls flat under the weight of its period-drama conventions and three performances that epitomize paycheck joylessness.
4035,m/children_of_huang_shi,Michael Dance,Rotten,2008-06-03,[Rhys-Meyers's performance is] the perfect microcosm for the entire film: capable but bland.
4036,m/children_of_huang_shi,Michael Phillips,Rotten,2008-10-18,"Very pretty but very stiffly written, The Children of Huang Shi strives for epic canvases relaying an intimate story."
4037,m/children_of_huang_shi,Amy Biancolli,Fresh,2008-06-20,"It's a sturdy film, vivid if utterly workmanlike, that builds to a crescendo of personal sacrifice and misty noble uplift."
4038,m/children_of_huang_shi,John Anderson,Rotten,2008-06-05,"The best thing about Children is the cinematography by Zhao Xiaoding (Hero, House of Flying Daggers), which is so distracting because it so out-classes the rest of the movie."
4039,m/children_of_huang_shi,Jeanne Aufmuth,Rotten,2008-06-06,An ill-conceived weeper that just won't say die.
4040,m/children_of_huang_shi,Marc Mohan,Rotten,2008-06-20,"The Children of Huang Shi is an old-fashioned story of courage and self-sacrifice in the face of war and deprivation. It's also sappy, boring and obvious."
4041,m/children_of_huang_shi,Alonso Duralde,Rotten,2008-05-20,"Chow actually gets saddled with the line, 'You have to tell the world what's happening here,' which was hoary back when D.W. Griffith was making movies."
4042,m/children_of_huang_shi,Bill Gibron,Rotten,2008-07-01,"The Children of Huang Shi is so desperate to be the Asian Schindler's List, an example of atrocity draped in abject artistry, that it forgets to lay out the context."
4043,m/childs_play_2019,Adam Patterson,Fresh,2019-06-21,"While not necessarily diving too deeply into any of the underlying statements it might be trying to make, it is a film that's acutely aware of what it is and delivers."

4054,m/childs_play_2019,Rosie Knight,Fresh,2019-06-20,A passable but plain remake that's saved by a blisteringly bonkers third act.
4055,m/childs_play_2019,Edward Douglas,Rotten,2019-06-20,An unnecessary throwback that never really needed to be revived. We were truly spoiled by last year's Halloween.
4056,m/childs_play_2019,William Bibbiani,Fresh,2019-06-20,"Suspenseful and funny enough that you almost forget you're watching a film about an evil Amazon Echo that bends over backwards, and nearly breaks, trying to look like a Child's Play remake instead."
4057,m/childs_play_2019,Jackie K. Cooper,Rotten,2019-06-27,I preferred Chucky being demon possessed rather than a computer glitch - and bring back Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky.
4058,m/childs_play_2019,Kok Yufeng,Fresh,2019-07-10,"Paying homage to its B-movie slasher roots, Child's Play finds inventive ways to up the gore, at the same time skewering the current culture of consumerism and digital obsession."
4059,m/childs_play_2019,Justin Chang,Rotten,2019-06-20,"Being an AI with faulty circuitry, Chucky 2.0 doesn't have the hilarious vulgarity or the single-minded murderous glee - the soul, if you will - that made Dourif's Chucky such an unnervingly human abomination."
4060,m/childs_play_2019,Meagan Navarro,Fresh,2019-06-20,"The stars of the film are the gory effects, the doll's design, and Hamill's animated voice work. Child's Play is pure entertaining fun for the horror fan, but not much else."
4061,m/childs_play_2019,Victor Stiff,Fresh,2019-06-26,"It's a half-baked social commentary, but at least director Lars Klevberg has more on his mind than raising Chucky's kill-count."
4062,m/childs_play_2019,Dan Jackson,Rotten,2019-06-21,"The movie wants to take aim at corporate consumer culture, offering up a sly critique of our tech-obsessed times, but it ends up feeling like yet another defective product."

4064,m/chips,"Robert Yaniz, Jr.",Rotten,2017-03-24,"A blatant attempt to apply the winning 21 Jump Street formula to another television property, CHIPS instead winds up a standard hard-R action comedy that audiences will probably forget by the time they leave the theater."
4065,m/chips,Adam Fresco,Rotten,2017-03-30,Fans of the TV show will likely find this portion of CHiPs about as far from the source as the Starsky & Hutch movie.
4066,m/chips,Robert Abele,Rotten,2017-03-23,"One more R-rated pileup of buddy-and-body humor, slathered with chases and collisions for that empty-calorie sumpn' extra. If you're looking for a whip-smart, hilariously meta-rethink like the 21 Jump Street movies, you've made a seriously wrong turn."
4067,m/chips,Daniel Eagan,Fresh,2017-03-23,"Lazily plotted, puerile, nonsensical, it's also occasionally witty and blithely indifferent to meeting expectations."
4068,m/chips,Jim Slotek,Fresh,2017-03-23,"Both Shepard and Pena are likable actors, and they do have chemistry together... But good-natured chemistry isn't enough to lift CHiPs anywhere near the ranks of the Lethal Weapons and Bad Boys that Shepard claimed to be aiming for."
4069,m/chips,Vicky Roach,Rotten,2017-04-12,An unrepentantly low-brow low point in the history of both buddy movies and TV remakes.

4073,m/chips,María Fernanda Mugica,Rotten,2017-03-25,The weakness of this film is its simple plot and its political correctness. [Full review in Spanish]
4074,m/chips,Stephen Schaefer,Fresh,2017-03-24,"In a low-life kind of silly way, the real laughs come from oversized personality clashes, hysterically pitched fights and a general awakening between our two misfits that they like each other."
4075,m/chips,Rendy Jones,Rotten,2018-08-30,Not everything has to be raunchy and rated R. Just because Sony did it doesn't mean you have to do it.
4076,m/chips,Ed Whitfield,Rotten,2017-03-28,A movie that hates itself and its audience.
4077,m/chips,David Nusair,Rotten,2017-03-24,"...there is, in the end, no denying the movie joins the ranks of several other misguided comedic remakes of '80s television series (eg 21 Jump Street)."
4078,m/chips,Marija Djurovic,Rotten,2017-03-29,"A lazy, vulgar and painfully idiotic buddy-cop comedy that is as generic and predictable as they come."
4079,m/chips,Matt Brunson,Rotten,2017-07-01,"The crudity flows as easily as the violence in this low-IQ outing, with a special emphasis on gay panic humor and an even greater emphasis on sexist humor (this is the sort of film that suggests that if a woman isn't a 10, she might as well kill herself)."
4080,m/chips,Allen Adams,Rotten,2019-02-12,"Despite an at-times desperate desire to entertain, CHiPs never manages to transcend its juvenile baseline."
4081,m/chips,Gary Thompson,Fresh,2017-03-23,"The new movie version of CHIPS is smart to have jettisoned just about everything about the original, except the basic plot ..."
4082,m/chips,MaryAnn Johanson,Rotten,2017-03-27,"Toilet humor, cars exploding for no reason, random naked boobies, and gay panic... although, weirdly, also lots of awkward, unerotic nearly naked Dax Shepard."

4087,m/citizen_kane,Matt Brunson,Fresh,2011-01-20,"Citizen Kane has been cited as the greatest film ever made from so many different quarters, it's a wonder that a Congressional law hasn't been passed making it required viewing for anyone who claims they like movies."

4090,m/citizen_kane,John C. Mosher,Fresh,2018-09-06,"It is a triumph of the film, and proof of its solid value and of the sense of its director and all concerned, that a human touch is not lost. Sympathy for the preposterous Mr. Kane survives. Indeed, there is something about him which seems admirable."
4091,m/citizen_kane,Rob Fraser,Fresh,2007-04-06,It remains a gloriously entertaining classic.
4092,m/citizen_kane,Steven D. Greydanus,Fresh,2004-05-31,"A cinematic perfect storm of technique and sophistication, widely hailed as the apotheosis of all the innovations and advancements of the sound era."
4093,m/citizen_kane,Robert Hanks,Fresh,2009-10-30,"It would be nice to be able to buck the critical orthodoxy and say how tired and overrated Citizen Kane is; but the dulll truth is, it's still, indisputably, one of the great masterpieces of cinema."

4101,m/citizen_kane,SMH Staff,Fresh,2020-05-06,"Citizen Kane, written, produced, and directed by a young man of 25 whom America considers a genius, is an outstanding film, amazing in its presentation and vast in its conception."

4111,m/citizen_koch_2013,Joe Williams,Fresh,2014-06-19,"Most of the movie is a backgrounder on the Citizens United case, in which a deeply divided Supreme Court opened the door to truckloads of campaign cash from tycoons and corporations."
4112,m/citizen_koch_2013,Nora Lee Mandel,Rotten,2014-06-06,Too bad they didn't turn a grudge [against PBS] and resulting freedom into a more hard-hitting documentary that would more effectively prove their points.

4146,m/city_of_angels,Bob Bloom,Rotten,2000-01-01,"City of Angels requires a deft, poetic hand. It's a fragile story that needs to unfold slowly without sledgehammering its audience. Unfortunately, those behind the enterprise haven't the required skill."
4147,m/city_of_angels,Rob Blackwelder,Fresh,2000-01-01,"A powerful, somber and highly intellectual picture, it is not even remotely the kind of thing one would expect to a Hollywood studio to mold into a star vehicle."

4150,m/city_of_angels,Bryant Frazer,Rotten,2000-01-01,An unconvincing new age melodrama that plays like Death and Dying for Dummies.

4154,m/city_of_angels,David Keyes,Fresh,2000-01-01,"Manages to update [Wings of Desire] so that the freshness and passion still exist within the characters and the story. It is a triumph of conception, camera movements, and emotional feelings."
4155,m/city_of_angels,MaryAnn Johanson,Rotten,2000-01-01,"Glossy but with no heart, City of Angels is a smooth, unchallenging bit of fluff, about as romantic as a Hallmark card."
4156,m/city_of_angels,Laura Miller,Fresh,2000-01-01,"Although City of Angels sometimes dances perilously close to the line between romance and schmaltz, it never crosses it, a nifty maneuver when you consider that the story deals with both love and spirituality, two areas land-mined with cant."

4257,m/collateral_beauty,John Lui,Rotten,2017-01-05,"There is nothing wrong with a wide emotional palette, but director David Frankel leans too heavily on the healing and the homilies in the rush to closure; the smugness of the therapy-talk leaks into and wrecks everything else."

4577,m/dance_girl_dance,Emanuel Levy,Fresh,2007-04-28,"Arguably Dorothy Arzner's most personal film, this chronicle of female friendship is an anomaly: a feminist film made before feminism existed, directed by Hollywood's only female director, and a buddy picture before the genre was invented."

4584,m/dance_girl_dance,Robin Karney,Rotten,2015-09-28,"Pioneering female director Dorothy Arzner, who took over at short notice after filming commenced, does her best with an inadequate script and a miscast O'Hara; she manages to bring the film to life from time to time -- usually when Ball is on screen."
4585,m/dance_girl_dance,Richard Brody,Fresh,2016-05-30,"Arzner films it with fascination and enthusiasm, and the choreography is marked by the point of view of the spectators and the dancers' awareness that they're being watched."

4616,m/date_and_switch,Elizabeth Weitzman,Fresh,2014-02-13,"In its sloppy humor and unabashedly earnest expressions of friendship and romance, the movie feels like any likable, and generally forgettable, teen comedy. And yet with its casually handled twist, the genre ambles forward just a little bit."
4617,m/date_and_switch,Erik Adams,Rotten,2014-02-13,"It's a movie about being true to yourself that's reluctant to let its real character show. At any point that it looks likely to tweak sex-comedy convention or get truly weird, it reverses course at the last minute."
4618,m/date_and_switch,Simon Abrams,Rotten,2014-02-14,"The subject certainly isn't dated, but the film's dull post-John Hughes, sub-Judd Apatow style of comedy is like a just-buried time capsule full of accumulated clichs."

4711,m/deadpool,Rebecca Pahle,Fresh,2016-09-20,"Ryan Reynolds was born in a damn lab to play this role, and T.J. Miller is equally good as possibly the most realistic superhero sidekick ever."
4712,m/deadpool,Kirsten Acuna,Fresh,2019-10-27,"From the moment the film begins and you see the words ""directed by an overpaid tool"" and ""produced by a-hats"" on screen, you know ""Deadpool"" isn't going to be like any other superhero movie you've seen before."

4717,m/dear_white_people,Duane Dudek,Fresh,2014-10-23,It holds a comic lens up to the love-hate relationship between the races in all its contradictions. And it is a portrait of post-racial America as the symbiotic clashing of opposite polarities.
4718,m/dear_white_people,Kirk Honeycutt,Fresh,2014-10-14,"Clearly a work by a young director, the film comes at you with a torrent of sharp dialogue, multiple characters and a traffic jam of scenes and story points."

4728,m/dear_white_people,Noah Gittell,Rotten,2014-10-16,"Viewers will spend more time waiting for the next witty retort than feeling moved or challenged. Dear White People is not sure whether it's an essay or a film, which means it's not quite either."
4729,m/dear_white_people,Ann Hornaday,Fresh,2014-10-16,"It's true that satire is the perfect weapon of reason, and Justin Simien deploys it with resourcefulness, cool assurance and eagle-eyed aim."

4741,m/death_of_a_cyclist,Marco Lanzagorta,Fresh,2019-09-10,The result is a dramatic story that deeply resonates with the cultural anxieties that Spanish society endured under the regime of General Francisco Franco.
4742,m/death_of_a_cyclist,Scott Tobias,Fresh,2019-09-10,"Death Of A Cyclist addresses all the grievances that Bardem mentioned at Salamanca, and it succeeds most at capturing the general climate of fear and oppression in Franco's Spain."

4748,m/death_wish_2018,Chris Sawin,Rotten,2019-09-02,"Death Wish isn't unwatchable, but it is dreadfully boring to an almost insulting extent. The film caters to obvious action thriller and revenge film stereotypes. It lacks stimulation of any kind and is the most generic vengeance imaginable."
4749,m/death_wish_2018,Matt Cipolla,Rotten,2020-07-23,"The concepts, struggles, and ideologies here aren't exaggerated. They're refracted, the film absentmindedly chasing its own tail while the world evolves around it."
4750,m/death_wish_2018,Mick LaSalle,Fresh,2018-03-02,"Willis is a worthy replacement for Bronson, and it can be safely said: This new movie is way better than all the ""Death Wish"" sequels that Bronson kept churning out, the last when he was 72."
4751,m/death_wish_2018,Jonathan W. Hickman,Rotten,2018-03-02,"By polishing the edges off, ""Death Wish (2018)"" fails to distinguish itself. It's just another revenge tale, where the deafening sound of gunfire neatly ties up all the loose ends."
4752,m/death_wish_2018,Damond Fudge,Rotten,2020-06-30,"Death Wish takes the original Charles Bronson film and updates it for today. Unfortunately, like most modern remakes of down and dirty movies of the 1970s, it feels so watered down."
4753,m/death_wish_2018,Tim Appelo,Rotten,2018-03-01,"This movie, a remake of the 1974 Charles Bronson film of the same name, is bad. But it's not the type of bad that's enjoyable or comedic - it takes itself too seriously for that."
4754,m/death_wish_2018,Jeffrey Lyles,Rotten,2018-03-02,Death Wish is a poorly timed rebuttal. And a pretty lousy one at that.

4759,m/death_wish_2018,Alan Jones,Fresh,2018-04-06,Roth's contemporary riff on the notorious 1974 thriller reaffirms its pulp fiction origins and puts the hardcore entertainment value back into the controversy of public paranoia over crime.
4760,m/death_wish_2018,William Bibbiani,Rotten,2018-03-02,"Death Wish takes the serious topic of vigilante violence and reduces it to melodramatic hero worship, and it's not even particularly good at that. The action is forgettable and the plot barely holds together."

4968,m/dior_and_i,Steve Erickson,Fresh,2018-10-22,"The excess detailed in the Saint Laurent films is well behind us - which is good for Simons' health, but perhaps not so good for documentary viewers looking for something beyond formulaic structures."
4969,m/dior_and_i,Laura Clifford,Fresh,2015-04-20,"This exceptional [cross cutting] structure allows the past to continue informing the present, reaching a climax after lights out in the ateliers, Tcheng projecting old Dior imagery over the white toiles that are the blueprints of Simons' first collection."
4970,m/dior_and_i,Rob Thomas,Fresh,2015-05-22,"""Dior & I"" is just good drama, quite moving and suspenseful as it shows talented and creative people pushing themselves to the edge. No matter how nice our clothes are, we're all human underneath."

4972,m/dior_and_i,A.O. Scott,Rotten,2015-04-09,"Access to an institution like the house of Dior is a rare and precious thing, and Mr. Tcheng has paid for it with a flattering portrait dressed up to look like cleareyed scrutiny."
4973,m/dior_and_i,Sean P. Means,Fresh,2015-05-16,"As Tcheng gets his cameras into the day-to-day operations of the Dior atelier, the movie becomes a portrait of the process - the hierarchies and traditions that turn ideas into wearable art."
4974,m/dior_and_i,Lisa Marsh,Fresh,2015-04-09,"Tcheng gets under Simons' skin - we see the designer's methods of work, insecurities, vulnerabilities and his ability to cut through the noise."

4983,m/dior_and_i,J. R. Jones,Rotten,2015-04-23,"A few gauzy montages of black-and-white archival footage glorify the fashion house's founder and namesake, providing a welcome interruption to all the self-serving confessionals and stage-managed conflicts."
4984,m/dior_and_i,Matt Shiverdecker,Fresh,2015-04-10,"Dior and I expertly observes all aspects of Simons' stressful transition, especially in the minutiae of being both an artist and a manager."
4985,m/dior_and_i,Melissa Anderson,Fresh,2015-04-10,"Though the film is unquestionably a flattering portrait of Simons, it is also more broadly, and more fruitfully, a testament to a tradition and to those who have upheld it for decades."

4992,m/disgrace,Ryan Stewart,Rotten,2009-09-17,"It's not Coetzee's assertion that the white minority South Africans must go a ways toward assimilating into African life to remain relevant that invites deep scrutiny, but the narrow vision presented here of Africanization as something akin to wilding."
4993,m/disgrace,Wendy Ide,Rotten,2009-12-04,It's hard to say what this solid but unadventurous film adds to Coetzee's powerful source material.

4997,m/disgrace,Bob Mondello,Fresh,2009-09-18,"Steve Jacobs' elegantly disturbing film follows the exploits - or, more accurately, the exploitations - of 52-year-old professor David Lurie, a dissolute aesthete whose erudition does little to mask grotesque character flaws."

5012,m/django_unchained_2012,Debbie Baldwin,Fresh,2018-11-07,"Yes, the sublime strays to the ridiculous. But all the while I just keep picturing Tarantino behind the camera re-imagining history and whispering to himself, This is so cool! If you like his style, this is another winner."

5016,m/django_unchained_2012,Jim Schembri,Fresh,2013-02-15,"Tarantino is, in essence, a classicist who invests the bulk of his drama and tension in lengthy dialogue exchanges that are infinitely more compelling that his elongated sequences of cathartic violence."

5379,m/evelyn,Jonathan Foreman,Fresh,2002-12-13,"Despite its treacly sentimentality, predictability and gutless evasiveness about the power of the church in 1950s Ireland, Evelyn manages to be an enjoyable piece of family entertainment."

5387,m/evelyn,Eleanor Ringel Cater,Fresh,2002-12-24,"With its personal feel, its more-than-capable cast and its rousing courtroom finale, it's the sort of picture that makes 'old-fashioned' a good thing."
5388,m/evelyn,Cherryl Dawson and Leigh Ann Palone,Rotten,2002-12-20,"Evelyn proves you can take an inspirational, true story with tons of potential, and with a bad script, water down the impact until nothing works exactly right."

5402,m/everyday_2013,David Sexton,Fresh,2012-09-14,"This could have been your average prison drama, all nasty warders and slamming doors. But it's not."
5403,m/everyday_2013,Joseph Walsh,Fresh,2018-08-23,"It won't be to everyone's taste, but Winterbottom must be commended for having the bravery to make a film that isn't afraid to be slow."

5406,m/everyday_2013,Catherine Shoard,Fresh,2012-09-13,"This is a strange and stirring film, which combines a Malick-ish concern with the emotional import of nature with a rare charm and levity. Everyday is a red letter treat."
5407,m/everyday_2013,Todd McCarthy,Rotten,2013-11-18,An admirable idea in theory proves to be a real slog to sit through.
5408,m/everyday_2013,Donald Clarke,Fresh,2013-02-17,"Utilising fluid shots of the English countryside set to one of Michael Nyman's most dynamic scores, Winterbottom makes something surprisingly lyrical of the non-story"

5439,m/exit_through_the_gift_shop,David Germain,Fresh,2010-04-16,The film is a curiosity. It's both an attempted documentary of an artistic movement and a bemused examination about why the movie failed in that mission.

5630,m/father_figures_2017,Richard Whittaker,Rotten,2017-12-28,It's not that Father Figures is irredeemably bad. It's that it's so predictable and yet so tonally disjointed.

5647,m/ferdinand,Robert Kojder,Rotten,2017-12-13,"Bookended by a charming beginning and ending, Ferdinand loses its way through the middle stretch quickly becoming the type of animated feature every critic dreads watching and writing about."
5648,m/ferdinand,Rolando Gallego,Rotten,2018-01-03,Conveys the spirit of the story...while providing new characters that bring humor and necessary relief. [Full Review in Spanish]
5649,m/ferdinand,Bill Zwecker,Fresh,2017-12-13,"Most important, ""Ferdinand's"" anti-bullying message is an important lesson kids of all ages need to see - again, and again."
5650,m/ferdinand,Jamie East,Fresh,2017-12-15,"John Cena does a great voice job and although the best supporting characters are the snooty German dancing horses, it's Kate McKinnon's stupid goat that really brings this to life."
5651,m/ferdinand,Jane Horwitz,Fresh,2017-12-14,"In the title role, wrestler-turned-actor John Cena gives Ferdinand just the right balance of sweetness and strength. He becomes the wholly convincing center of the parable."
5652,m/ferdinand,Julie Washington,Fresh,2017-12-15,"""Ferdinand's"" message of peace and friendship makes it a perfect holiday movie, even though there's not a snowman or Santa in sight."
5653,m/ferdinand,Aine O'Connor,Fresh,2017-12-18,"Although it is unlikely to enter into the realm of animation classics, Ferdinand is sweet and well-intentioned."
5654,m/ferdinand,Ed Potton,Fresh,2017-12-14,... a movie of both substance and silliness. Olés all round.
5655,m/ferdinand,Marc Savlov,Rotten,2017-12-14,Ferdinand doesn't really do justice to its evergreen and far less cluttered source material.
5656,m/ferdinand,Alex Welch,Fresh,2017-12-13,"With a funny set of side characters and a lovably kindhearted lead, Ferdinand finds a way to promote being kind to others without becoming an afterschool special. Granted, it doesn't ever go out of its way to be very unique or surprising."
5657,m/ferdinand,Alison de Souza,Rotten,2017-12-20,"The visual and verbal humour is cartoonish rather than clever and it recycles gags seen in far too many animated films, such as animals in a high-speed car chase."
5658,m/ferdinand,Mark Dujsik,Rotten,2017-12-15,"At its heart, this is a simple story ... but it's obvious that the filmmakers aren't content with simple."
5659,m/ferdinand,James Dyer,Fresh,2017-12-11,"Inoffensive fun, but unlike its paperback forbear, the cinematic Ferdinand is unlikely to stand the test of time."
5660,m/ferdinand,Doug Jamieson,Rotten,2018-10-28,"A fairly flat, shallow experience for anyone over the age of 10. It's really a film you can plonk your kids in front of, while you find something else to do instead."
5661,m/ferdinand,Jim Schembri,Fresh,2017-12-24,"Cute, Pixar-like, slightly overlong animated adventure about a non-violent, flower-loving, hippie-type bull who is compelled into the ring against his conscience."
5662,m/ferdinand,Richard Propes,Fresh,2020-09-07,A joy-filled film filled with heart and humor and an embrace for all that makes us different and all that makes us wonderful.
5663,m/ferdinand,James Croot,Fresh,2017-12-27,"The first feature-length version of Munro Leaf and Robert Lawson's much-loved more-than-80-year-old children's book, Ferdinand is an amiabull, entertaining romp for cinemagoers for all ages."
5664,m/filly_brown_2012,David Rooney,Fresh,2012-01-21,"Gina Rodriguez's magnetic star turn keeps this often overwrought film engaging, even when the script lets her down."
5665,m/filly_brown_2012,Simon Abrams,Rotten,2012-01-22,There's no essential truthfulness to Majo's emotional journey.
5666,m/filly_brown_2012,Robert Koehler,Rotten,2012-01-24,"A trite piece of storytelling, with character development and plot points that feel not so much lived in as borrowed from other movies."

5672,m/filly_brown_2012,Sean O'Connell,Rotten,2013-04-26,"A routine music business cautionary tale, the film shuffles its decks ever so slightly by casting a Latino actress as its lead, but doesn't do enough to shed the exasperating confines of the star-is-born genre."
5673,m/filly_brown_2012,Annlee Ellingson,Rotten,2013-04-26,"The movie works best as a showcase for Rodriguez, transcending its simplistic script and clichéd plot in snatches -- when its leading lady is at the mike and especially in the film's final awkward family reunion."
5674,m/filly_brown_2012,Louis Black,Fresh,2013-04-26,"Sure, we've all seen this story before, but that doesn't hamper this film from being enormously entertaining, with riveting performances, great beats, and poetic rhymes."
5675,m/filly_brown_2012,Michael Dequina,Rotten,2013-05-06,"However much earnest commitment and passion that the cast lend to their roles, it ultimately cannot overcome the routine structure and approach to the overall execution."
5676,m/filth_and_the_fury,Jeff Vice,Fresh,2000-01-01,It is refreshing to hear things from the band's viewpoint and not to have to suffer through McLaren's self-congratulation.
5677,m/filth_and_the_fury,Frank Swietek,Fresh,2000-01-01,Certainly engaging to watch and often compelling to ruminate on.
5678,m/filth_and_the_fury,Ed Kelleher,Fresh,2000-01-01,"Temple's visually inventive collage of newsreel footage, television commercials, weather reports and similar 'found art' fits neatly into the Sex Pistols saga."
5679,m/filth_and_the_fury,David N. Butterworth,Fresh,2000-01-01,"Never mind the bollocks, this 'Pistols doc is the real deal."
5680,m/filth_and_the_fury,Roger Ebert,Fresh,2000-01-01,To see this film's footage from the '70s is to see the beginning of much of pop and fashion iconography for the next two decades.

5682,m/filth_and_the_fury,Jason Clark,Fresh,2002-02-07,"A dazzling and challenging film, fully seizing the opportunity to make a documentary film burst with vitality."
5683,m/filth_and_the_fury,Chuck Rudolph,Rotten,2002-03-08,Temple's repetitive style grows tiresome.
5684,m/filth_and_the_fury,Jon Niccum,Fresh,2002-11-12,"Unlike most rock documentaries that rely on abundant concert imagery and studio outtakes, Filth is less concerned with the music than the setting that produced it."
5685,m/filth_and_the_fury,Dan Lybarger,Fresh,2003-04-18,"A stylish, and engrossing look at the brief punk error."
5686,m/filth_and_the_fury,Jeffrey M. Anderson,Fresh,2003-07-25,Loaded with great music and classic Sex Pistols moments.
5687,m/filth_and_the_fury,Cole Smithey,Fresh,2009-04-13,"""The Filth and the Fury"" is the first punk rock documentary to lay out, in an editorial style, a thorough linear account of the last major musical movement of the twentieth century by way of that genre's fiercest example."
5688,m/filth_and_the_fury,Nell Minow,Fresh,2010-12-28,"Best for older teens, especially Sex Pistols fans."
5689,m/final_fantasy_vii_advent_children,Mike Sage,Fresh,2005-10-10,"less like a satisfying followup to a great gaming experience, and more a technical demo on how pretty those blocky FF characters could look on expensive new hardware."

5691,m/final_fantasy_vii_advent_children,David Cornelius,Rotten,2006-04-24,"This is third-rate sci-fi cobbled together with familiar elements of a video game some people like, and that's not nearly enough to work as a film."
5692,m/final_fantasy_vii_advent_children,Jeffrey Chen,Fresh,2006-04-25,"[The] battle scenes, during which all normal physics go straight out the window, are exhilarating in a disorienting thrill-ride way."
5693,m/final_fantasy_vii_advent_children,Scott Weinberg,Rotten,2007-03-07,"Once the characters start spewing out reams of dialogue about ""geostigma,"" ""sephiroth,"" and ""genova,"" my eyeballs involuntarily start to glaze over."
5694,m/final_fantasy_vii_advent_children,James Plath,Rotten,2009-06-07,"Great animation, but a narrative disappointment."

5698,m/firewalker,Scott Weinberg,Rotten,2002-07-26,"Almost embarrassingly bad Chuck Norris ""Raiders"" rip-off."
5699,m/firewalker,Vincent Canby,Rotten,2004-08-30,"When Mr. Norris, the former karate champion, isn't using his feet on ill-tempered Indians and Mexicans, he's stomping on the facetious dialogue, which deserves it more."
5700,m/firewalker,David Nusair,Rotten,2015-04-06,...a palpably worthless relic of the 1980s.
5701,m/firewalker,Ed Travis,Fresh,2019-03-01,a derivative film that feels slapped together and packaged for quick sale. But that doesn't mean I didn't have a blast watching it.
5702,m/firewalker,Mike Massie,Rotten,2020-09-06,"A girl fight on top of an unconscious Norris is a fun touch, but wasted wordiness, a stupidly cackling villain, and occult ceremonial mumbo-jumbo bog down the pacing."
5703,m/first_comes_love_2012,Brian Lowry,Rotten,2013-07-23,"By the end, this HBO presentation feels like one of those uncomfortable evenings where you visit a friend, and they bore you to death with images of their ultrasound."
5704,m/first_comes_love_2012,Sam Adams,Rotten,2013-07-23,[Approaches] a hot-button issue from the most suffocatingly narcissistic perspective imaginable ...
5705,m/first_comes_love_2012,Wes Greene,Rotten,2013-07-24,"Nina Davenport doesn't seem interested in taming her unwieldy vanity, and thus her documentary reads as a Match.com profile recontextualized as cinema narcissismo."
5706,m/first_comes_love_2012,Jeannette Catsoulis,Rotten,2013-07-24,"This midlife confessional could have reached beyond the maternal cravings of highly educated, urban-dwelling singletons had it plumbed people's heads as thoroughly as Ms. Davenport's birth canal."
5707,m/first_comes_love_2012,Joe Neumaier,Fresh,2013-07-25,There are many glimmers of truth - as well as what can best be described as accidental insight - in Nina Davenport's painful but beautiful documentary about becoming a parent.
5708,m/first_comes_love_2012,Doris Toumarkine,Fresh,2013-07-25,"But the family drama that simmers beneath is really what intrigues: the questionable quality of her parents' marriage and the disturbing truths that hint at her father's harsh, unloving behavior towards her."
5709,m/first_comes_love_2012,Farran Smith Nehme,Rotten,2013-07-26,"Davenport makes desultory attempts to bring in other mothers, but she is not an interviewer adept at drawing out scintillating observations."
5710,m/first_comes_love_2012,Alan Scherstuhl,Fresh,2013-08-14,"First Comes Love is, before anything else, a portrait of a longing so deep that even the commandingly articulate Davenport struggles to put it into words."
5711,m/first_comes_love_2012,Jamie S. Rich,Rotten,2013-11-19,"There are some fascinating insights, particularly as her infant son makes her re-examine her childhood...but ""First Comes Love"" also suffers from being self-obsessed."
5712,m/first_comes_love_2012,Radheyan Simonpillai,Fresh,2014-01-30,"Davenport's diary film effectively mines the issues when facing such monumental decisions for the first hour. Then comes the baby, and the film loses direction. Davenport stops being a filmmaker and becomes a parent."

5733,m/first_reformed,Robbie Collin,Fresh,2017-08-31,"Schrader and his cast commit to the project with sharpened and unblinking seriousness, even when the going gets mesmerically weird, with violence, visions, levitations and Neil Young protest songs chanted sombrely by toxic swamps."

5935,m/fresh,Desson Thomson,Fresh,2000-01-01,"[Fresh] is urgently lyrical, right down to its final, haunting image. And in lead performer Sean Nelson, first-time filmmaker Yakin has a 12-year-old breath of fresh air whose beatific face could launch a thousand scripts."
5936,m/fresh,Richard Corliss,Fresh,2015-04-21,[Fresh is] made with a subtle precision that suggests a Vermeer landscape of the ninth circle of hell.
5937,m/fresh,Kim Newman,Fresh,2015-04-21,"The strength of the piece is that it realises which aspects of its genre have been seen too many times, always coming back to Nelson's blank but expressive stare as he watches terrible things the director doesn't need to shove in our faces."

5941,m/fresh,Gary Thompson,Fresh,2015-04-21,"An unpredictable and harrowing story that works on the surface as an unconventional thriller (an intricate plot) and underneath as a powerful story of love, sacrifice, willpower and the dehumanizing cost of violence and revenge."

6095,m/gasland,Joseph Jon Lanthier,Rotten,2010-09-26,"There's an acerbically straightforward, old-fashioned muckrake gurgling with righteous pugnacity beneath the mannered surface of Josh Fox's Gasland."
6096,m/gasland,Katie Hewitt,Fresh,2010-07-23,"It's not pretty, but it works for some. Gasland won a special jury prize at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival."
6097,m/gasland,Trevor Johnston,Fresh,2011-01-12,"While the hushed tones of Fox's would-be naïf commentary slightly grate after a while, his film's images, contrasting natural beauty with industrial horror show, are bracingly effective indeed."
6098,m/gasland,Rob Nelson,Fresh,2010-09-14,"With its jolting images of flammable tap water and chemically burned pets, New York theater-director-turned-documentarian Josh Fox's Sundance-feted shocker makes an irrefutable case against U.S. corporate ""fracking."""
6099,m/gasland,Matthew Pejkovic,Fresh,2010-11-19,GasLand engrosses as an informative and shocking look at the natural gas boom and the destruction it wrought upon the American heartland.

6101,m/gasland,Sam Davies,Fresh,2011-01-18,"With a remorselessness all the more powerful for its quiet unfussiness, Fox builds up a riveting portrait of near-apocalyptic environmental damage and a corporate mindset willing to ruin water sources irrevocably for the sake of a few years' profit."
6102,m/gasland,Andrew L. Urban,Fresh,2010-11-11,"It's raw and rough and flawed, but it's an important and deeply disturbing film and one that ironically highlights the importance of personal freedoms in democracies - however flawed they all are"
6103,m/gasland,Kathi Maio,Fresh,2020-03-10,"GasLand shows ordinary Americans setting their formerly potable kitchen tap water on fire, it looks like a special effect, but sadly isn't."

6108,m/gauguin_voyage_to_tahiti,David Parkinson,Rotten,2017-12-21,"Edouard Deluc's account of Paul Gauguin's first expedition to French Polynesia doesn't just gloss over the artist's flaws, it airbrushes them out of a story that bears little resemblance to reality."
6109,m/gauguin_voyage_to_tahiti,Rex Reed,Rotten,2018-07-13,"The film has beautiful cinematography and occasional peaks of high drama, but lacks the kind of significant tempo necessary to sustain enough interest for nearly two hours to keep a viewer focused."
6110,m/gauguin_voyage_to_tahiti,Nicholas Bell,Rotten,2018-08-25,Deluc's trouble begins with an adapted screenplay which seems more inclined towards a travelogue.
6111,m/gauguin_voyage_to_tahiti,CJ Johnson,Rotten,2018-05-31,"The script must have had a lot of empty white space. This is a truly boring movie, in which barely anything happens."
6112,m/gauguin_voyage_to_tahiti,Boyd van Hoeij,Rotten,2017-09-27,The love triangle as depicted here isn't a strong enough structure to support either a traditional three-act configuration or a looser association of ideas connected to Gauguin and his life.
6113,m/gauguin_voyage_to_tahiti,Matthew Roe,Fresh,2018-07-31,"Gauguin: Voyage to Tahiti is mixed emotional experience that greatly excels in some areas, though ultimately doesn't quite go as far as it should."

6115,m/gauguin_voyage_to_tahiti,Pat Brown,Rotten,2018-07-09,"Gauguin represents for the film no less an ideal Romantic subject than the Polynesians represented for the painter himself: penniless, chronically ill, and living in self-imposed isolation—the very embodiment of the suffering artist."

6117,m/gauguin_voyage_to_tahiti,Ed Potton,Rotten,2017-11-03,Vincent Cassel lays on the tortured-artist schtick extra-thick in this ultimately tedious French-language portrait of the artist Paul Gauguin.
6118,m/gauguin_voyage_to_tahiti,Stephen Romei,Fresh,2018-06-01,"The other highlights come from France and, of all places, Ballarat. The first is the sumptuous cinematography by Pierre Cottereau. The best scene shows Gauguin riding alone in the lush landscape."
6119,m/gauguin_voyage_to_tahiti,Kevin Crust,Fresh,2020-01-20,"The film is too brief to be revelatory and is not the virtual museum experience it appears to aspire to, but does serve as a strong introduction to the artist for the uninitiated and offers a deeper dive into Gauguin's portraiture."
6120,m/gauguin_voyage_to_tahiti,Leigh Paatsch,Rotten,2020-08-11,Such shonky rewriting of history - simply to bolster seductive notions of the artist as some kind of intrepid adventurer of the creative spirit - amounts to nothing more than a cynical confidence trick.
6121,m/gauguin_voyage_to_tahiti,Stefan Pape,Fresh,2017-10-31,"A fascinating period in Gauguin's life to explore, and couple that with the remarkable lead performance by Cassel, and you're left with a biopic that's most definitely worth catching."

6127,m/get_on_up,Jeff Beck,Fresh,2014-07-31,"There's more than enough here to recommend it, especially when you factor in Boseman's skillful portrayal and a phenomenal soundtrack that reminds you just how much of a musical genius Brown truly was."
6128,m/get_on_up,Katie Smith-Wong,Fresh,2019-11-19,"[T]his show ultimately belongs to [Chadwick] Boseman. He captures the groove, soul and even [James] Brown's incompressible speech and his performance is electric."

6136,m/get_on_up,Kirk Honeycutt,Rotten,2014-07-31,"What the film seems to be running away from is the fact that for all his genius, James Brown was not a man you would want to spend much time around."
6137,m/get_on_up,Joe Gross,Fresh,2014-07-31,"The movie is strongest when focusing on the co-dependent-before-that-was-a-term relationship between Byrd and Brown. Byrd worships Brown, but even he has his limits; Brown needs to be worshipped but believes in little but himself."
6138,m/get_on_up,Travis Hopson,Fresh,2014-07-31,"This ""brand new bag"" of a biopic is coursing with energy thanks to an electric, rousing performance by Boseman that simply must be seen."
6139,m/get_on_up,Peter Rainer,Rotten,2014-08-01,"The storytelling is mostly linear, with some confusing back-and-forth in the chronology, and it's a long slog. The Brown who emerges from this film has a monstrous ego to go with his monster talent."
6140,m/get_on_up,Jen Chaney,Fresh,2014-07-31,"These kinds of Hollywood pop stardom portraits usually flop or fly based on their casts and the ebullience of their musical scenes. ""Get on Up"" wins on both fronts."

6142,m/get_on_up,David Jenkins,Rotten,2014-11-21,There's more drama in one track from Live at the Apollo than 139 long minutes of this.
6143,m/get_on_up,Scott Foundas,Fresh,2014-07-28,"Whatever else one may fault about ""Get On Up,"" one thing that's faultless is its star, Chadwick Boseman, who plays Brown from age 16 to 60 with a dexterity and invention worthy of his subject."

6154,m/gett_the_trial_of_viviane_amsalem,Anthony Lane,Fresh,2015-02-16,"Almost all of the film takes place inside a courtroom, at irregular intervals over five years, but there is no sense of drag or slump; on the contrary, the action quivers with tension, impatience, comic heat, and, beneath it all, an irrepressible rage."
6155,m/gett_the_trial_of_viviane_amsalem,Bob Bloom,Fresh,2015-03-29,"What the film, directed by Elkabetz and her sibling, Ronit, does, is cast a harsh light on a dark segment of Israeli society that is mostly obscured from the outside world."

6191,m/glassland,Jason Best,Fresh,2015-04-24,"A miscast, not fully convincing Collette hits some wrong notes along the way. Reynor, though, is superb, and his tightly wound, taciturn performance lets us feel the clenched desperation of the young cabbie's plight."

6250,m/going_shopping,Robert Denerstein,Rotten,2006-03-31,"Jaglom's concentrated approach serves up some insight to be sure, but the movie states its case in the first 10 minutes and then proceeds to run out of things to say, almost as quickly as the women in this movie think they've run out of things to wear."

6716,m/hell_night,Jeff Beck,Rotten,2018-01-01,"Hell Night may have an intriguing set-up, but ultimately it suffers from bland execution and a rather uneventful narrative, which results in just another forgettable slasher from the 80s."
6717,m/hell_night,Austin Trunick,Fresh,2018-03-06,This particular slasher set itself apart from the era's deluge of them by being somewhat of a genre-mashup with an old school haunted house movie ... you practically expect Vincent Price to step out and reveal himself from behind a curtain.
6718,m/hellion_2012,Jeff Meyers,Fresh,2014-07-09,"Candler's plotting is predictable and her characters should be substantially deepened, but her ability to capture the rage of male adolescence and the numbness of grief is nothing less than superb."

6734,m/hellion_2012,Anders Wright,Rotten,2014-07-10,"The acting is stronger than the rest of the film itself, which sports far too much shaky camera work and a conclusion that is obviously foreshadowed by the appearance of a gun early on."

6740,m/high_art,James Sanford,Fresh,2000-01-01,"As a once-acclaimed photographer who drifted out of the New York art scene into a private world of drugs and dead-end relationships, Sheedy is a genuine revelation; gone are the days when she coasted by on charm and her girl-next-door smile."

6743,m/high_art,Roger Ebert,Fresh,2000-01-01,"Patricia Clarkson succeeds in creating a complete, complex character without ever overplaying the stoned behavior. Radha Mitchell is successful at suggesting the interaction of several motives: love, lust, curiosity, ambition, admiration."

6750,m/high_art,Jason Best,Fresh,2016-08-14,"Clarkson's Greta... is wickedly funny, while Mitchell's ingnue convincingly combines puppyish idealism and steely ambition. But it is Sheedy's Lucy, nonchalantly sexy, sharply intelligent, tough and vulnerable, who is the film's heart and soul."
6751,m/high_art,Gavin Smith,Fresh,2018-04-11,"High Art is often compelling and uncannily accurate in its evocation of downtown demi-monde characters and druggy, entropic milieu-the art in this film is high in more ways than one."
6752,m/high_art,Ren Jender,Fresh,2019-03-12,The film's treatment of women's sexuality is a nice contrast to the lesbian-bed-death clichés (and anti-chemistry) of Julianne Moore and Annette Bening in [Lisa] Cholodenko's more recent The Kids Are All Right.

6775,m/hockney,Charlotte O'Sullivan,Fresh,2014-11-28,"Hockney has always been fascinated by sleights of hand, double bluffs and illusions. Wright's documentary is at its most intimate when it acknowledges a painful fact: our national treasure is bloody hard to pin down."
6776,m/hockney,Mark Adams,Fresh,2016-04-05,"A life, work and spirited personality of acclaimed British artist David Hockney is wonderfully illustrated in Randall Wright's absorbing documentary Hockney."
6777,m/hockney,Phil Hall,Fresh,2016-04-22,"The artist comes across as an affable raconteur, and his personal input gives this film a sense of humor and irony that is most absent in Wright's lamentable attempt to share the Hockney experience with the audience."

6782,m/hockney,David Noh,Fresh,2016-04-26,"Randall Wright's documentary Hockney is as warm as the artist's chosen place of residence, laced with loving interviews by intimates of Hockney's which go back to his early youth in gray, drab Bradford, England."

7046,m/hunger_2008,Leo Goldsmith,Fresh,2008-10-07,"McQueen's film is not so much an attempt to reopen old wounds as a cinematic portrait of the wound itself, a visceral embodiment of politics at the very cellular level of those who engage in it."

7064,m/hunter_killer,Norman Wilner,Rotten,2018-10-24,"The constant agitation and bone-deep respect for all things military is straight out of Clancy's playbook, but there's no Jack Ryan figure to humanize it all...There's very little to hold on to.

7110,m/i_hate_valentines_day,Stephen Holden,Rotten,2009-07-03,"You might blame Nora Ephron, whose screenplay for When Harry Met Sally established the formula that I Hate Valentine's Day runs into the ground. Compared with this, Ms. Ephron is Chekhov."

7138,m/i_heart_huckabees,Glenn Lovell,Rotten,2004-10-12,"An ambitious but disjointed spoof of New Age quirks and quacks that attempts to simultaneously put down and lift up. But, despite the A-list ensemble, it accomplishes neither."
7139,m/i_heart_huckabees,Doris Toumarkine,Rotten,2004-10-06,"There are plenty of attempts at absurdist, droll humor, but Huckabees is too eccentric for its own good."

7141,m/i_heart_huckabees,Nell Minow,Fresh,2004-09-30,"Brilliant use of the screwball comedy form to represent and explore existential themes...fodder for dorm debates and cultural studies theses, it is also a ton of fun."

7242,m/in_my_country,Forrest Hartman,Fresh,2005-06-02,"Intelligent piece that does its job as entertainment. More importantly, it should advance public knowledge about the apartheid government's human rights violations."
7243,m/in_my_country,Philip Martin,Fresh,2005-04-29,...the foxhole relationship that develops between Anna and Langston is completely natural -- up until the point where they fall into bed together.
7244,m/in_my_country,Derek Elley,Rotten,2005-03-07,"The combo of cultural cringe and a schematic, didactic screenplay strangles the human emotion."

7247,m/in_my_sleep,Duane Byrge,Fresh,2010-04-19,"A well-stirred titillation that will appeal to twentysomething audiences and movie-buff viewers who appreciate the pursued-pursuer, Hitchcockian style of suspenser."
7248,m/in_my_sleep,Vadim Rizov,Rotten,2010-04-22,"The biggest problem with Allen Wolf's thriller is that there are so few characters, it's immediately clear what's going on; there's simply no one to suspect besides the obvious."
7249,m/in_my_sleep,Marshall Fine,Rotten,2010-04-22,"An overstuffed Lifetime movie, if that network for women ever made movies about nice guys who happen to be sex-addicted murder suspects with a sleep disorder."
7250,m/in_my_sleep,Gary Goldstein,Rotten,2010-04-23,Writer-director Allen Wolf loads In My Sleep with so much psychosexual baggage you wish he just focused on one emotional affliction to propel this mediocre whodunit.
7251,m/in_my_sleep,John Anderson,Rotten,2010-04-23,"Aspires to the noble tradition of L.A. film noir, but boasts all the cerebral and aesthetic restraint of a West Hollywood dance club."
7252,m/in_my_sleep,S. James Snyder,Rotten,2010-04-28,All the labored explanations (and tedious psychology) that follow the bad behavior and bloodshed make for a serious buzzkill.
7253,m/in_my_sleep,Mike Hale,Rotten,2010-04-30,"Meant to be Hitchcockian -- the writer and director, Allen Wolf, more or less says so in his director's statement -- and maybe it is, if you think of it as, say, Hitchcock's senior project for film school."
7254,m/in_my_sleep,Lou Lumenick,Rotten,2010-04-30,Did a hunky LA massage ther apist kill someone in their sleep? Perhaps the biggest problem with Allen Wolf's drowsy thriller In My Sleep is managing to stay awake long enough to find out.
7255,m/in_my_sleep,Brent Simon,Rotten,2010-07-09,"For a while pulls levers of dramatic engagement competently if never rivetingly, but unravels into a labyrinthine tangle of soap-y contrivance and improbably centralized conflict."
7256,m/in_my_sleep,Chris Hewitt,Rotten,2011-08-19,"Hideous-looking, poorly acted, nonsensical and a waste of actor Tony Hale (Buster from ""Arrested Development""), ""In My Sleep"" could turn you into a sleepmoviegoer."
7257,m/in_my_sleep,Brian Orndorf,Rotten,2011-12-26,"Little screen finesse to support Wolf's aspirations, leaving behind an ambitious but inept production that has difficulty maintaining chills, thrills, and, well, camera focus."
7258,m/incarnate_2016,Molly Henery,Fresh,2018-11-02,"While Incarnate exceeds many of my expectations, there are still things that fall a bit short of what could be a near perfect reinvention of a possession film. The scientific aspects and the acting are definitely the highlights."

7261,m/incarnate_2016,Marija Djurovic,Rotten,2016-12-13,Incarnate [comes] across as a cheap and relatively ineffective blend of The Exorcist and Inception.
7262,m/incarnate_2016,Rashid Irani,Rotten,2016-12-31,The preposterous climax is merely a ploy to ensure a sequel -- a proposition that is scarier than anything else in Incarnate.
7263,m/incarnate_2016,Mike Reyes,Fresh,2016-12-02,"Not a perfect film, by any means. But instead, it exists as an entertaining film that could mark the beginning of the next horror franchise to bring audiences into theaters on a regular basis."

7267,m/incarnate_2016,Noel Murray,Rotten,2016-12-02,"Dense with plot and mythology, the film is refreshingly unpredictable - if only because guessing what comes next would require understanding what the hell is going on."
7268,m/incarnate_2016,Micheal Compton,Rotten,2018-11-03,Too convoluted for its own good. The film takes itself seriously when it probably should have embraced its borderline silliness.
7269,m/incarnate_2016,Sam Fragoso,Rotten,2016-12-02,"Strident rhetoric is required for describing Brad Peyton's latest film, a maddening hodgepodge of ideas that range from undercooked to unoriginal."
7270,m/incarnate_2016,Matt Donato,Rotten,2016-12-02,"Incarnate is just another buried Blumhouse special, and I assure you its neglect is with good reason."
7271,m/incarnate_2016,Trace Thurman,Rotten,2018-10-31,Bland direction and a by-the-numbers script make for an ultimately unsatisfying viewing experience.
7272,m/incarnate_2016,Jordy Sirkin,Rotten,2020-07-11,"While it attempts to change up the exorcist themes, it ultimately falls flat, as it really isn't giving the viewer much by way of entertainment or scares."
7273,m/incarnate_2016,Katie Rife,Rotten,2016-12-02,"It's all a wild jumble of half-baked, derivative ideas and arbitrary rules, all of which add up to a suspense-free horror narrative as murky as its lighting."
7274,m/incarnate_2016,Peter Sobczynski,Rotten,2016-12-02,Incarnate is such a pointless bit of hackwork that it almost makes the recent horror dud Shut In seem focused by comparison.
7275,m/incarnate_2016,Joe Leydon,Fresh,2016-12-02,"Offers a relatively fresh take on standard-issue exorcism-melodrama tropes, along with a performance by Aaron Eckhart that is more than persuasive enough to encourage the investment of a rooting interest."
7276,m/incarnate_2016,Fernando Santoyo Tello,Rotten,2017-01-12,"The result isn't even close to what could be expected, since its ending it's like a pastiche of many things and nothing at the same time. [Full review in Spanish]"
7277,m/incarnate_2016,Dennis Schwartz,Rotten,2017-09-07,"A low-rent horror film in need of an exorcist, as it never recovers from being cursed with a bad script."
7278,m/infini_2015,Simon Foster,Rotten,2015-05-07,"Script and storytelling shortcomings aside, it is the overarching familiarity of Abbess' visual cues that derails his ambition."
7279,m/infini_2015,Dov Kornits,Fresh,2015-05-07,"Like all great sci-fi, Infini is filled with big ideas, but this is ultimately an action thriller with the futuristic, space traveling milieu a background."

7281,m/infini_2015,Simon Abrams,Fresh,2015-05-11,"For a while, it's exciting enough to feel brand-new."
7282,m/infini_2015,Harry Windsor,Rotten,2015-05-11,"It's rare to see a film, much less a genre film, in which clarity is so willfully -- brazenly -- withheld."
7283,m/infini_2015,Sarah Ward,Rotten,2015-05-14,"Audiences acquainted with everything from Aliens to The Thing, Event Horizon to Sunshine, and even The Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Prometheus, will find few surprises in Infini's depths beyond its unwavering genre devotion."
7284,m/infini_2015,Zach Hollwedel,Rotten,2015-05-27,Infini needs a substantial re-edit before it's worthy of an audience's time.

7286,m/infini_2015,Andrew Marshall,Fresh,2015-07-29,"Infini displays well enough its dark and grimy vision of the future, with the realisation of industrial sci-fi technology and how people's lives become affected by such advancements, but it lacks the follow through to capitalise on its ideas."
7287,m/infini_2015,Adam Woodward,Rotten,2015-09-17,Ambitious stuff but there's a lot here which simply doesn't hold up under scrutiny.
7288,m/infini_2015,David Hughes,Rotten,2015-09-17,An exposition-heavy opening gives way to a modestly effective Australian mash-up of sci-fi/horror hybrids.
7289,m/infini_2015,Mike McCahill,Rotten,2015-09-17,Infini is too busy generating crashes and bangs to clarify the rules of its own skin-flaying game.
7290,m/infini_2015,Wendy Ide,Rotten,2015-09-18,"Infini is a space zombie movie that features decent production design but an undecipherable plot, which is not at all helped by the pages of expository dialogue bellowed at lung-busting volume."
7291,m/infini_2015,Geoffrey Macnab,Rotten,2015-09-18,"This clunky, claustrophobic, Aussie-made dystopian thriller has a plot that seems to have been constructed out of odds and ends from Ridley Scott and Christopher Nolan sci-fi movies."
7292,m/infini_2015,Matt Glasby,Rotten,2016-10-31,"Confusing at the start, bonkers in the middle and unintelligible by the end"
7293,m/infini_2015,Matthew Bond,Rotten,2017-10-26,"It's one of those maddening, testosterone-laden features that lost me in minutes, won me back and then lost me completely again."
7294,m/inside_daisy_clover,Jonathan Rosenbaum,Rotten,2000-01-01,"The talented director Robert Mulligan, apparently engulfed by studio overproduction, falters at times, not always knowing whether to play things straight or for laughs."
7295,m/inside_daisy_clover,Film4 Staff,Rotten,2003-05-24,"Wood has one great breakdown scene, reminiscent of Judy Garland (an inspiration for the character) but she lacks the star's range and depth of emotion, and the songs don't hold a candle to Arlen and Co."
7296,m/inside_daisy_clover,Howard Thompson,Rotten,2005-05-09,"There have been better pictures about Hollywood, but few as triumphantly, all-round bad as Inside Daisy Clover."
7297,m/inside_daisy_clover,David Thompson,Fresh,2006-02-09,"Gavin Lambert's screenplay (from his own novel) lives in the land of the ambiguous and fey, which is probably why the film now seems subtle and attractive."
7298,m/inside_daisy_clover,Variety Staff,Rotten,2008-10-27,"Covering a two-year period, the outcome is at times disjointed and episodic as the title character played by Natalie Wood emerges more nebulous than definitive."
7299,m/inside_daisy_clover,Emanuel Levy,Fresh,2009-03-23,"Director Mulligan can't find the right tone for Gavin Lambert's inside Hollywood tale about a girl rise to stardom before collapsing and so the story veers from a cautionary fable to Gothic melodrama to farce, but some of the acting is good."

7304,m/inside_daisy_clover,David Denby,Rotten,2013-05-01,"Wood's movements are spasmodic and graceless. The director Robert Mulligan can't quite find the rhythm, either. Some of the picture is whimsical, some of it as lugubrious as a horror movie."
7305,m/inside_daisy_clover,Joan Didion,Rotten,2020-03-04,"Only Christopher Plummer and Katherine Bard... seem to know what the point of the picture is. If the director, Robert Mulligan, ever knew, it slipped his mind while he was photographing the beach in sun-washed blues, like a set for Carousel."
7306,m/inside_daisy_clover,Matt Brunson,Rotten,2020-05-30,"Inside Daisy Clover isn't exactly a camp outing, but it's also impossible to take seriously."
7307,m/inside_daisy_clover,Danielle Solzman,Fresh,2020-07-20,Inside Daisy Clover isn't a perfect film by any means but it offers an inside look at Hollywood life in the 1930s.

7309,m/inside_deep_throat,Gary Thompson,Rotten,2005-02-18,"A bubbly but superficial documentary that tells you what you already know -- there was a sexual revolution in the '70s, and its influence on society was both liberating and corrupting."
7310,m/inside_deep_throat,Glenn Whipp,Fresh,2005-02-11,"Colorfully entertaining, sexually explicit and occasionally insightful."

7312,m/inside_deep_throat,Jeff Vice,Rotten,2005-03-18,"Unfortunately, just when the film really starts to explore an idea, it moves on to the next one. And the bit about how the adult-film industry has changed since the 1970s was done more effectively in the fictional Boogie Nights."
7313,m/inside_deep_throat,Pam Grady,Fresh,2005-02-11,"The contemporary interviews, for the most part, are notable for their wit, but it's the historical record that makes Inside Deep Throat so fascinating."

7315,m/inside_deep_throat,Tom Long,Fresh,2005-02-11,"The film leaves no doubt that the movie was an important cultural lynchpin in the '70s, but its import beyond those crazy, heady days may have been swept away by the home video revolution."

7317,m/inside_deep_throat,Sean Burns,Fresh,2005-03-05,It's a treasure trove of kicky archival footage-- and a pointed look back at the opening salvo in a culture war that still rages today.
7318,m/inside_deep_throat,Jules Brenner,Fresh,2005-02-11,The movie is pornographic. The documentary about the movie is pornographic. Is the review of the documentary pornographic?
7319,m/inside_deep_throat,Maitland McDonagh,Fresh,2005-02-11,"Fenton and Barbato also place Deep Throat firmly in the context of a turbulent time, when making a sex movie was an act of rebellion (however Quixotic), rather than a mercenary grab for the goodies."
7320,m/inside_deep_throat,Desson Thomson,Rotten,2005-02-10,It's a fascinating story but not so fascinatingly told.

7325,m/inside_deep_throat,Brian Gibson,Fresh,2005-04-07,What makes Inside Deep Throat not so easy to swallow is the way it forces us to take a good hard look at our own voyeuristic reflexes or snap moral judgments.
7326,m/inside_deep_throat,Ken Hanke,Fresh,2005-04-27,"Deep Throat was of its era and important to it -- but the film did not, as this documentary would have you believe, create that more permissive era."
7327,m/inside_deep_throat,Andrew Sarris,Rotten,2005-03-31,The absorption of Deep Throat into the political melodrama that was Watergate seems to have led to some grandiose statements in Messrs. Bailey and Barbato's documentary.
7328,m/insurgent,Robert Denerstein,Fresh,2015-05-01,Adds a bit of pep to the series' overall mediocrity
7329,m/insurgent,Roger Moore,Rotten,2015-03-17,"The finale, at least, gives one hope that this series will finally diverge from its YA ""Hunger Games"" formula in the next film."
7330,m/insurgent,Tori Brazier,Fresh,2019-05-14,"The plot's a bit stretched out, but good performances and the series' impressive production value mean it's a serviceable stopgap before the real action of Allegiant."
7331,m/insurgent,Geoffrey Macnab,Fresh,2015-03-19,"It least Insurgent has very lively performances from Woodley as the action heroine, James as her square-jawed beau, Ansel Elgort as her detached brother Caleb and Miles Teller (from Whiplash) as the Iago-like Peter."
7332,m/insurgent,Edward Johnson-Ott,Rotten,2015-03-18,"It would've been nice to tell you Insurgent was surprisingly good. Or fun to rant and rave about how lousy it is. But no. It's just there, another middle installment of another teen-targeted post-apocalyptic series."

7338,m/insurgent,John Serba,Rotten,2015-03-23,"Dauntless, Divergent, Erudite, Abnegation, Factionless, Candor. May I add the audience faction, Ennui? If ever a screenplay felt bludgeoned lifeless by a thesaurus, this is it."

7374,m/into_the_forest,John DeFore,Fresh,2015-10-06,Beautiful and sensitive to character but gripping when it needs to be.
7375,m/into_the_forest,Devan Coggan,Fresh,2016-08-01,"Page and Wood, who are both in their upper 20s, hardly make for convincing teenagers, but they both lend weight to Eva and Nell's sisterly bond as the two siblings slowly unravel."
7376,m/into_the_forest,Scott Tobias,Rotten,2015-09-16,"Connecting the incidents in Hegland's book gives Into the Forest plenty of dramatic kick, but the film leaves the impression that the characters' full selves remain stubbornly on the page, as thoughts not translated into action."
7377,m/into_the_forest,Nigel M. Smith,Rotten,2015-09-16,Patricia Rozema's drama doesn't burrow deep into its end of world scenario.
7378,m/into_the_forest,Peter Sobczynski,Fresh,2016-07-29,"A strong, smart and moving end-of-the-world drama that is further bolstered by strong performances from co-stars Ellen Page and Evan Rachel Wood."
7379,m/into_the_forest,Laura Kern,Fresh,2016-09-06,"Nell and Eva's relationship forms the heart of the film and, along with the fleeting moments of ecstasy they find in things previously taken for granted, their bond provides something of genuine beauty in a progressively bleak world."
7380,m/into_the_forest,Susan G. Cole,Fresh,2015-09-16,Rozema proves herself to be master of mood.
7381,m/into_the_forest,Sara Stewart,Fresh,2016-07-28,"Wood and Page generate a believable, prickly sibling closeness in Rozema's unhurried but harrowing micro-portrait of how easily civilization could crumble."
7382,m/into_the_forest,David D'Arcy,Fresh,2015-09-16,"It's an inspiring story, acted with heart and grit by Paige and Wood, and film directed with adroitness by Rozema in a ruin of a set in the woods."
7383,m/into_the_forest,Frank Wilkins,Fresh,2016-07-29,"If character-driven drama pieces aren't your thing, then this one might not be for you."
7384,m/into_the_forest,Charles Bramesco,Fresh,2015-09-16,"Though not without its errors, Into The Forest turns a profoundly human eye to what just may be the very end of humanity itself."
7385,m/into_the_forest,Louisa Moore,Fresh,2018-12-20,An intensely bleak feminist-tinged apocalyptic tale of sisterly love and devotion taken to the extreme.
7386,m/into_the_forest,Manohla Dargis,Rotten,2019-03-04,"The movie lacks urgency. The world may be burning; here, it barely simmers."
7387,m/into_the_forest,Frank Ochieng,Fresh,2018-11-09,"...[an] intimate, gripping and quietly thoughtful post-apocalyptic drama. Undoubtedly, Into The Forest marches into the wayward woods of darkness in what amounts to be a surreal, disastrous fairy tale tainted in psychological turmoil."
7388,m/into_the_woods_2014,Kristy Puchko,Fresh,2014-12-19,"Fine family fun, as you'd expect from Disney, [that] dishes out some spectacular song numbers, heart-lifting performances, and even some belly laughs."
7389,m/into_the_woods_2014,Jesse Hassenger,Fresh,2014-12-23,"Even if this Into The Woods lacks the exhilaration of the best movie musicals, it does capture the show's emotional intimacy -- no small task in a field that favors razzle dazzle."
7390,m/into_the_woods_2014,Leslie Combemale,Fresh,2019-08-02,It is also necessary to give props to the amazing music and congratulate all the actors who took on very complicated songs and made them their own.
7391,m/into_the_woods_2014,Mick LaSalle,Fresh,2014-12-23,"With archness and irony, ""Into the Woods"" goes deeper into the fairy stories, allowing us to see familiar archetypes in new and not so flattering ways."
7392,m/into_the_woods_2014,Susan Granger,Fresh,2014-12-19,"Tuneful and enchanting...Dare I say it's even better than the stage version?Because Stephen Sondheim's intricate music and insightful, tongue-twisting lyrics are crystal-clear."
7393,m/into_the_woods_2014,Abbie Bernstein,Fresh,2018-12-20,"Into the Woods is very good, engaging as it runs and admirable afterwards, but it somehow misses being brilliant. Perhaps this is congruent with its message about the hidden cost of fairytales, which makes sense."
7394,m/into_the_woods_2014,Leonie Hayden,Fresh,2015-01-08,"The film belongs to the divine Ms. Streep, who is by turns funny, vulnerable, philosophical and terrifying..."
7395,m/into_the_woods_2014,Kent Turner,Fresh,2014-12-20,"[Emily Blunt's] the heartbeat of the film, providing it with its most winning and empathetic performance ... She's the film's most valuable player."
7396,m/into_the_woods_2014,Robbie Collin,Fresh,2014-12-17,"It's all vigorous fun, a wonderful, wintry entertainment, but its branches catch at your heart."
7397,m/into_the_woods_2014,Debbie Baldwin,Fresh,2018-11-02,"The acting is wonderful. Not surprisingly, Meryl Streep was made for the part, and Emily Blunt is particularly charming."
7398,m/into_the_woods_2014,Robert Roten,Rotten,2014-12-30,"This musical, based on the Sondheim - Lapine play has some good performances, but the story is a disaster. It reminds me of stories Saturday Night Live's Michael O'Donoghue used to tell, like 'The Little Engine that Died.'"
7399,m/into_the_woods_2014,Jonathan Romney,Rotten,2014-12-19,"Marshall delivers Into the Woods to the screen dutifully, but what's lost is the real point of the show as an exploration of storytelling-& the playfulness too, in both senses, for stage Sondheim is both ludic & fully mindful of its own status as play."
7400,m/into_the_woods_2014,John Hanlon,Fresh,2014-12-24,A delightfully-staged Disney musical that offers up a few great musical moments.
7401,m/into_the_woods_2014,Donald Clarke,Fresh,2015-01-08,"Thanks heavens for a terrific Emily Blunt who, as the occasionally tortured Baker's Wife, seems intent on single-handedly battering the piece back towards respectability."
7402,m/into_the_woods_2014,Wendy Ide,Fresh,2015-01-09,I imagine it helps if you love the music.
7403,m/into_the_woods_2014,Rob Vaux,Fresh,2015-01-05,"It performs its duties competently, benefits from some fantastic casting, and gives us some fun tunes to whistle on our way home. But Sondheim was hunting for bigger game."
7404,m/into_the_woods_2014,Marshall Fine,Rotten,2014-12-26,"Busy without being involving, energetic without having much excitement... And the lesson is this: Everyone dies, sooner or later."
7405,m/into_the_woods_2014,Chris Barsanti,Fresh,2014-12-22,"Disney's film of Stephen Sondheim's ironic fairy tale musical keeps the master's gorgeous melodies, knowing lyrics, and finger wagging intact."
7406,m/into_the_woods_2014,Laura Clifford,Fresh,2014-12-24,"Chris Pine sends up his golden boy image as the Prince who's charming if not sincere, his singing amusingly exaggerated with trills and flourishes, but his shared number with Rapunzel's Prince begins the film's mid section bog down."
7407,m/into_the_woods_2014,Michael Smith,Rotten,2018-02-16,"Although the comedy works, [its] detriments take away any heart that the film hoped to achieve, leading to an ending that finds the characters uniting out of exasperation, rather than any purpose."
7408,m/isnt_it_romantic_2019,Kam Williams,Rotten,2019-05-14,Not a picture this critic feels comfortable recommending to any demographic. Consider that a fair warning.
7409,m/isnt_it_romantic_2019,Gary Thompson,Rotten,2019-02-13,"If you want to see a funny, effective love story featuring a + sized character, try Stan & Ollie."
7410,m/isnt_it_romantic_2019,Peter Howell,Rotten,2019-02-12,A sloppily written story that fails as both romance and comedy.
7411,m/isnt_it_romantic_2019,Ben Kenigsberg,Rotten,2019-02-12,"""Isn't It Romantic"" is designed to leave viewers feeling lightheaded and forgetful. That dizzy sensation could be love - or a mild head injury."
7412,m/isnt_it_romantic_2019,Rohan Naahar,Fresh,2019-02-28,"It isn't the kind of film you'd want to introduce to your parents, but it's a perfectly acceptable fling - the sort of movie that bumps into you on a busy street, offers a sheepish apology, asks you out for coffee and promptly disappears from your life."
7413,m/isnt_it_romantic_2019,Marjorie Baumgarten,Rotten,2019-02-14,"Isn't It Romantic, the film, is ""a dream that can be heard,"" but only as a counter melody to the main theme."
7414,m/isnt_it_romantic_2019,Tricia Olszewski,Rotten,2019-02-15,"The scripters try to circumvent the tropes and inject a little feminist spirit into the plot development, though it turns out to be somewhat of a cheat."
7415,m/isnt_it_romantic_2019,Christy Lemire,Fresh,2019-02-13,"Though it's tasty and enjoyable while you're watching it, you'll realize how hungry you are for something heartier soon after you've come down from your sugar high."
7416,m/isnt_it_romantic_2019,Chris Knight,Fresh,2019-02-15,"Despite the whirlwind nature of these romances, audiences will be forgiven for shouting out to Natalie and Josh that they're clearly meant to be with each other."
7417,m/isnt_it_romantic_2019,Jenna Dorsi,Fresh,2019-02-20,"[The film was] clearly made by people who love the genre. Its satire is self-aware but not mean-spirited. It doesn't ridicule its audience for wanting to watch rom-coms, it simply demonstrates how one can love something yet still recognizes its faults."
7418,m/isnt_it_romantic_2019,Peter Gray,Fresh,2019-05-04,"One of the better example of the genre, and it helps that its cast are all wholly capable of both playing to and against the stereotypes."
7419,m/isnt_it_romantic_2019,Jim Judy,Rotten,2019-02-14,"An occasionally charming and sporadically funny offering that otherwise feels like a bit of a disappointment and certainly a missed opportunity. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sexual Content, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
7420,m/isnt_it_romantic_2019,tt stern-enzi,Fresh,2019-03-04,A weird meta take on romantic comedy.
7421,m/isnt_it_romantic_2019,Stephanie Zacharek,Fresh,2019-02-13,"The picture is honest about human hopes and disappointments, even as it acknowledges-and offers-the pleasures of a good romantic comedy."
7422,m/isnt_it_romantic_2019,Bilge Ebiri,Fresh,2019-02-14,It's the Inception of rom-coms. Sort of.
7423,m/isnt_it_romantic_2019,Kate Erbland,Fresh,2019-02-12,"Every trope, twist, and trick of the genre is up for skewering in the comedy, but the film keeps things light and smart, never dipping into darkness or crass jokes."
7424,m/isnt_it_romantic_2019,Michael A. Smith,Fresh,2019-02-13,"With two of the ""Pitch Perfect"" films behind them, Wilson and Adam Divine have built an amazing rapport, and it shows on the screen."
7425,m/isnt_it_romantic_2019,Matt Goldberg,Fresh,2019-02-13,Todd Strauss-Schulson's delightful movie carefully walks the line between mocking romantic comedies and giving the genre a loving tribute.
7426,m/isnt_it_romantic_2019,Peter Debruge,Fresh,2019-02-12,It's way more fun rooting for Rebel than it is pretending to care whether Katherine Heigl will get the guy.
7427,m/isnt_it_romantic_2019,Matthew Razak,Rotten,2019-02-12,"The movie says nothing about anything, it's jokes are simply there to make references to terrible cliches that aren't really cliches anymore."
7428,m/its_all_gone_pete_tong,Jean Lowerison,Fresh,2005-05-14,"Noisy and difficult to watch, but worth it for Kaye's performance."
7429,m/its_all_gone_pete_tong,Scott Andrews,Fresh,2005-06-04,Kaye manages to conjure a fully realized character where there could so easily have been a shambling collection of clichés.
7430,m/its_all_gone_pete_tong,Peter Debruge,Rotten,2005-05-13,"It's strange to think that anyone might fall for the ruse, considering that a giant badger makes occasional guest appearances whenever Wilde's drug use gets out of hand."
7431,m/its_all_gone_pete_tong,David Noh,Rotten,2007-03-01,"This has writing that could charitably be called inane, and a wholly repulsive star."
7432,m/its_all_gone_pete_tong,Russell Scott Smith,Fresh,2005-04-15,"Has the same propulsive, punk-rock vibe as Trainspotting and 24 Hour Party People."
7433,m/its_all_gone_pete_tong,Marty Mapes,Fresh,2005-06-04,"Doesn't live up to its billing, but is an enjoyable movie that rings in your ears"
7434,m/its_all_gone_pete_tong,Carlo Cavagna,Fresh,2005-05-19,An initially hilarious mockumentary whose sense of humor goes deaf as it wears on.
7435,m/its_all_gone_pete_tong,Phil Hall,Fresh,2005-05-22,Brilliant performance by Paul Kaye.
7436,m/its_all_gone_pete_tong,Jonathan W. Hickman,Fresh,2005-05-21,The magic of It's All Gone Pete Tong is that it becomes seriously engaging even though it is filled with off the wall zany moments.
7437,m/its_all_gone_pete_tong,Robert Wilonsky,Fresh,2005-05-13,"The movie leaves us with a broad, genuine smile, not the smirk born of so many mockumentaries. This is phony, absolutely, but the good feeling it leaves behind is plenty real."
7438,m/its_all_gone_pete_tong,Sean Piccoli,Fresh,2005-05-12,It's All Gone Pete Tong practically yanks the viewer along the wild arc of Frankie's life. But there's no other way to travel through the rock-star world he inhabits.
7439,m/its_all_gone_pete_tong,Mark Palermo,Fresh,2005-07-06,There's unexpected tenderness in the sincerity with which Dowse plunges into Disability Movie conventions.
7440,m/its_all_gone_pete_tong,Marc Savlov,Fresh,2005-06-12,A smart albeit uneven jab at everything from the clubbing life to the male inclination toward Peter Pan.
7441,m/its_all_gone_pete_tong,Lisa Kennedy,Fresh,2005-05-27,This is biopic as raving rumination. But it is also a surprisingly compassionate redemption story.
7442,m/its_all_gone_pete_tong,Michael O'Sullivan,Fresh,2005-05-13,"Just inspiring enough, just scary enough, just sappy enough and just funny enough to get by."
7443,m/its_all_gone_pete_tong,Brian Mckay,Fresh,2005-04-11,"Frankie Wilde's ride is a wild one indeed, and IT'S ALL GONE PETE TONG manages to capture the essence of both his madness and genius"
7444,m/its_all_gone_pete_tong,Richard Nilsen,Fresh,2005-05-12,"The film cannot be said to be a success as an aesthetic whole, but the power of the first half and the exceptionally believable acting of Kaye make this the kind of experience that only film can provide."
7445,m/its_all_gone_pete_tong,Phil Villarreal,Rotten,2005-07-06,"When Kaye tries to be funny, he's odd; when he tries to be sad, he's boring; and when he tries to be happy, he's . . . just weird."
7446,m/its_all_gone_pete_tong,Philip Martin,Fresh,2005-06-10,Metafiction is a dangerous game to play ...but it's apparent writer-director Dowse has faith. Let's hope that faith is rewarded; we need more of this kind of quirky satire.
7447,m/its_all_gone_pete_tong,Dan Jardine,Fresh,2005-07-12,Paul Kaye's performance is revelatory. A surprisingly warm-hearted mockumentary.
7448,m/itzhak,Gayle MacDonald,Fresh,2018-04-06,"We get to know the man: the jovial grandfather, the joke teller, the dedicated husband, the patient teacher and loyal friend..."
7449,m/itzhak,Sherilyn Connelly,Fresh,2018-04-06,The film occasionally touches upon dark subjects - we're told so many Jewish people played the violin during the Holocaust because was it was the easiest instrument to pick up and run away with - but Itzhak's primary modality is joy.
7450,m/itzhak,Martha K. Baker,Fresh,2018-04-11,Fine and joyful documentary.
7451,m/itzhak,Simon Abrams,Fresh,2018-03-08,Think of Itzhak as a revealing scrapbook of Perlman's favorite stories.
7452,m/itzhak,Trisha Brown,Fresh,2018-04-07,Chernick has made an engaging film about an ordinary guy who happens to also be an extraordinary musician.
7453,m/itzhak,John Anderson,Fresh,2018-03-15,"""Praying with the violin"" is how an old friend describes the art of Itzhak Perlman in ""Itzhak,"" and by the time these words are said, the viewer is convinced."
7454,m/itzhak,David Noh,Fresh,2018-03-08,Highly intelligent and warm portrait of the most haimische virtuoso who ever lived.
7455,m/itzhak,Bilge Ebiri,Fresh,2020-03-17,Itzhak perhaps achieves the greatest poignancy when Perlman tries to get at the mysterious beauty of the music he loves and plays.
7456,m/itzhak,Christopher Llewellyn Reed,Fresh,2018-04-23,"Watch it, listen to the music, and experience the joy of Perlman's genius."
7457,m/itzhak,Helen T. Verongos,Rotten,2018-03-08,"We get a brief dip into his family's past and emigration from Israel, but the filmmaker never digs deeply enough to reveal any other substantial dimension of this man, or her theories about what shaped him."
7458,m/itzhak,Frank Scheck,Rotten,2017-10-11,"Despite its many engaging moments, Itzhak will likely prove frustrating for viewers desiring more information."
7459,m/itzhak,Jared Mobarak,Fresh,2018-04-18,Watching [Itzhak Perlman] onscreen removed from his art and yet still so connected to it becomes our education and ultimately inspiration.
7460,m/itzhak,Harvey S. Karten,Fresh,2018-03-05,Heavenly music and compelling commentary from one of the world's foremost violinists who is also a mensch.
7461,m/itzhak,Richard Whittaker,Fresh,2018-05-25,"It's charming rather than captivating, a fine sketch rather than a finished portrait."
7462,m/itzhak,Linda Cook,Fresh,2019-10-17,"Like its subject, ""Itzhak"" is filled with the joy of music."
7463,m/itzhak,Ken Eisner,Fresh,2018-04-13,"The PBS-styled doc doesn't exactly explore Itzhak Perlman's hidden depths, but heck, that's what the music is for."
7464,m/itzhak,Glenn Sumi,Fresh,2018-04-05,"What makes the doc watchable, of course, are the musical sequences, whether he's playing Tchaikovsky, Bach or Williams."
7465,m/itzhak,Zachary Lewis,Fresh,2018-03-20,"If you don't already know and love violinist Itzhak Perlman, you will after watching ""Itzhak."""
7466,m/itzhak,Jordan Hoffman,Fresh,2018-06-05,An inspiring and upbeat film.
7467,m/itzhak,Tricia Olszewski,Fresh,2018-04-05,"Naturally, Chernick devotes the bulk of the doc to Perlman's performances and frames them with a biography-lite. Refreshingly, she stays away from the typical newbie-to-superstar timeline."
7468,m/jack_and_jill_vs_the_world,Mark Keizer,Rotten,2008-04-11,"Considering the talent assembled, the only audience draw here is the prospect of getting out of the rain."
7469,m/jack_and_jill_vs_the_world,Brian Orndorf,Fresh,2008-04-17,"There's an overwhelming and quite repellent amount of gloss applied to the finished product, yet underneath it all are many scenes of honest emotional confession, distributed through wonderful atypical performances."
7470,m/jack_and_jill_vs_the_world,Peter Debruge,Rotten,2008-04-24,"Parise no doubt intends the pic's attention to the disease -- + animal adoption and fair trade coffee -- to be socially enlightening, but it feels suspiciously like sympathy-mongering."
7471,m/jack_and_jill_vs_the_world,Sam Sweet,Rotten,2008-04-24,"More farce might have served the film well; as Parise draws from a playbook of medical melodrama and romantic-comedies clichs, her moral about living outside the box becomes harder and harder to swallow."
7472,m/jack_and_jill_vs_the_world,Robert Abele,Rotten,2008-04-25,Blind to the fact that it should be rising up against its own formulaic kind.
7473,m/jack_and_jill_vs_the_world,Matt Pais,Rotten,2008-04-26,"Achieves the holy trinity of painful earnestness, combining cute animals, sick teenagers and an idealistic belief in love and goodness that's actually deceptively judgmental."
7474,m/jack_and_jill_vs_the_world,Jules Brenner,Rotten,2008-04-26,"Written, directed, acted-in and produced by Parise, she's proven her creds as a one-woman employment agent. But, by now, she should be picking up that directing is a weak spot."
7475,m/jack_and_jill_vs_the_world,David Nusair,Fresh,2008-12-05,...ultimately establishes itself as an affable endeavor that benefits substantially from the charismatic work of its two leads.
7476,m/jack_goes_home,Keith Watson,Rotten,2016-10-10,The film veers almost at random from ghost story to family drama to erotic thriller to black comedy.
7477,m/jack_goes_home,Matt Donato,Rotten,2016-10-12,"Jack Goes Home is a breakdown you can't quite grasp, despite some genre merits that certainly embrace the dark."
7478,m/jack_goes_home,April Wolfe,Rotten,2016-10-12,What's more disappointing than the competing storylines is the emotional void created by these joyless characters.
7479,m/jack_goes_home,Andy Webster,Rotten,2016-10-13,"The script, by Mr. Dekker, spirals into a muddle of ambiguity, leaving only the imagery and the performances to save the movie. And try as they might, they cannot."
7480,m/jack_goes_home,Noel Murray,Rotten,2016-10-13,"While the movie's artfully made and daringly disturbing, Dekker ultimately overestimates how many sick twists one motion picture needs."
7481,m/jack_goes_home,Jared Mobarak,Fresh,2016-10-13,"This is the ""snap"" people talk about: that indefinable moment where the person you couldn't fathom doing anything heinous transforms into a killer without rhyme or reason."
7482,m/jack_goes_home,Jeffrey Lyles,Rotten,2016-10-14,"Jack Goes Home triples down on weird and stays in a dark, twisted place. It's a grueling, joyless viewing experience."
7483,m/jack_goes_home,Todd Jorgenson,Rotten,2016-10-14,... loses coherence about halfway through and falls apart with a series of clumsy revelations.
7484,m/jack_goes_home,Andy Crump,Rotten,2016-10-14,"The horror elements ... [are] insultingly cheap and appallingly lazy, a collection of parlor tricks deployed in a movie that overstays its welcome by 20 minutes."
7485,m/jack_goes_home,Kat Hughes,Fresh,2018-08-30,"[It's] an original and intriguing film that offers a unique perspective on the idea of self, the movie presenting an odd mid-life crisis at twenty-something."
7486,m/jack_goes_home,Trace Thurman,Rotten,2018-10-31,There is no subtext in Jack Goes Home. It's just text. Nothing is left to the imagination.
7487,m/jack_goes_home,Emilie Black,Fresh,2020-04-19,"The film looks great and has very good performances that grab you and make you want to see what happens next, how it ends."
7488,m/jackie_and_ryan,Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat,Fresh,2015-07-06,A tender romantic drama about two music lovers who face steep and unruly challenges during hard times.
7489,m/jackie_and_ryan,Robbie Collin,Fresh,2014-09-08,A low-key romance may be the beginning of a comeback for Katherine Heigl
7490,m/jackie_and_ryan,Bilge Ebiri,Rotten,2015-07-04,"The film feels like an uncomfortable hodgepodge of styles and tones - gritty and realistic when it's following Ryan, awkwardly staged when it's following Jackie."
7491,m/jackie_and_ryan,Todd Jorgenson,Fresh,2015-07-10,"There's a familiar tune to this modest low-budget romance about musicians who fall in love, yet it's given a fresh spin by a set of charming performances and a screenplay that generally sidesteps cliches."
7492,m/jackie_and_ryan,Sandie Angulo Chen,Fresh,2015-07-10,Sweet if unexciting love story about two musicians.
7493,m/jackie_and_ryan,Shikhar Verma,Fresh,2020-05-03,[Jackie & Ryan] is about a pair of struggling people trying hard to make everything alright.
7494,m/jackie_and_ryan,Katherine Pushkar,Fresh,2015-07-01,"For a Katherine Heigl vehicle, ""Jackie & Ryan"" stars a whole lot of Ben Barnes. Not that there's anything wrong with that."
7495,m/jackie_and_ryan,Catherine Bray,Rotten,2015-06-29,"The best thing about it is is that it shies away from formula, and the worst is either the finger tattoos, or the fact that it hasn't really come up with much to replace the formula it so carefully and laudably avoids."
7496,m/jackie_and_ryan,Guy Lodge,Fresh,2014-09-08,"Mellow, digestibly sweet and embellished with lovely folk tunes, this modest bit of Americana reveals pleasing new sides of both leads ..."
7497,m/jackie_and_ryan,Jesse Hassenger,Rotten,2015-07-02,"The section of the movie that should offer a climactic rush, however fleeting, feels instead more like falling action, or even a postscript."
7498,m/jackie_and_ryan,Stephen Holden,Fresh,2015-07-02,"You anticipate a cheap, sentimental ending. But it is not to be, and the movie is much the better for it."

7504,m/jackie_and_ryan,Sherilyn Connelly,Rotten,2015-07-01,"Jackie & Ryan is a sort of low-rent Nicholas Sparks romance that, for want of a better way to put it, never generates any sparks of its own."
7505,m/jackie_and_ryan,MaryAnn Johanson,Fresh,2015-07-03,"A romance of a gentle, bittersweet, grownup variety that doesn't pretend that every connection has to be a grand, sweeping, happily-ever-after thing."

7507,m/jackie_and_ryan,Nick Allen,Rotten,2015-07-03,"If a film based on author Nicholas Sparks' work is like an over-produced power ballad with a 128-piece orchestra, writer/director Ami Canaan Mann's ""Jackie & Ryan"" is the non-ironic acoustic guitar cover of the same tune."
7508,m/jalsaghar,Rob Nelson,Fresh,2000-01-01,"The director's moody visual style befits his complex look at a character not unlike Orson Welles' Charles Foster Kane--a misanthrope who, despite his wealth of toys, has doomed himself to living arrogantly impoverished and alone."
7509,m/jalsaghar,Sean Axmaker,Fresh,2017-07-01,"Graceful, melancholy, directed with a reserved elegance, The Music Room observes the old-world feudal life of the 1920s fading into irrelevance with both sympathy and disparagement."
7510,m/jalsaghar,John Gillett,Fresh,2020-02-10,"Although it cannot be said to outclass the best parts of [Ray's Apu] trilogy, it proves to be an engrossing experiment in a deliberately minor key."

7539,m/jeffrey,Malcolm Johnson,Fresh,2018-05-02,Every scene with Stewart and Batt delivers at least one masterstroke. But hilarious moments stud Rudnick's screenplay. His knack for dialogue and satire calls to mind some of the great screenwriters of Hollywood's golden era
7540,m/jeffrey,Matt Brunson,Rotten,2019-06-22,"The energy level drains away once the picture turns serious, and what remains is a somber plotline that was handled far more effectively in such works as And the Band Played On and Longtime Companion."

7544,m/jeffrey,Roger Ebert,Rotten,2000-01-01,It's more a series of sketches and momentary inspirations than a story that grows interesting.
7545,m/jeffrey,Fred Topel,Fresh,2003-07-14,"Outstanding comedy. Effectively portrays the romance of gay relationships, with a Woody Allen tone of comedy."

7567,m/jerk,Shane Burridge,Fresh,2002-09-30,"Despite its shortcomings, THE JERK is a good example of how the big screen welcomes some comedians much more easily than others"
7568,m/jerk,Richard Corliss,Rotten,2019-07-19,"Carl Reiner, who has made his own contributions to comedy with Sid Caesar, Mel Brooks and Dick Van Dyke, does little to set a mood or rhythm or even an aura of good feeling that will carry audiences over the slow spots."
7569,m/jerk,John Skow,Rotten,2009-02-02,"Its humor is successful and unsuccessful by turns, and although Comedian Carl Reiner is the director, the instinct here is to give most of both credit and blame to Martin."

7572,m/jerk,Roger Ebert,Rotten,2005-07-05,"We get the sense at times that the cast and crew arrived at a location, found the script bankrupt of real laughs, and started looking around for funny props."

7581,m/jexi,Jackie K. Cooper,Rotten,2019-10-22,"Adam Devine is more enjoyable in small doses - like supporting roles and not leading the charge. Michael Pena, we feel your pain. Come back, all is forgiven - this, Dora, everything!"
7582,m/jexi,Andrew Lapin,Rotten,2019-10-14,"The stranded DeVine, for all his goofy charms as an actor, quickly exhausts our patience; he's in nearly every frame of this movie, and his screen partner is a phone, which means a hell of a lot of mugging for the camera."
7583,m/jexi,John DeFore,Rotten,2019-10-11,"Nearly everything misfires here - bizarrely so, since we can see where the laughs should come, how they would work, and how a more competent movie would get from A to Z."

8013,m/la_sapienza,Nicole Armour,Fresh,2015-08-03,"While Green's film is dense with historical fact and theory, it's not averse to plumbing life's mysteries. Suffused with warmth, it expresses a potent admiration for human striving and accomplishment."

8035,m/land_of_mine,Matt Prigge,Rotten,2017-02-10,It's a well-intentioned movie that winds up favoring sentimentality over genuinely disturbing introspection.

8040,m/land_of_mine,Leigh Paatsch,Fresh,2017-03-29,"After laying some considerable scripting groundwork in a patience-testing opening act of the movie, Zandvliet transports us deep inside the haunted, hunted psyches of these blighted souls with uncommon sincerity and compassion."
8041,m/land_of_mine,Brad Wheeler,Fresh,2017-02-17,"Zandvliet has crafted a handsome, affecting and questioning film about post-war revenge and forgiveness. On a tough field to navigate, he makes it to the other side, commendably."
8042,m/land_of_mine,Sean P. Means,Fresh,2017-04-06,"(Mller""s) portrayal of a crusty sergeant rediscovering his humanity doesn't quite excuse the clichs that fill Land of Mine, but it makes the experience bearable."

8054,m/landline,Al Alexander,Fresh,2017-07-29,There's an affinity you form with the characters -- especially the budding camaraderie between Dana and Ali -- that enables the movie to involve and intrigue.

8059,m/landline,Elias Savada,Fresh,2017-07-29,"Ultimately, Landline registers as a push me-pull me emotional drama about four members of a family that are spinning uncomfortable semi-comic, barely-tragic circles around one another."
8060,m/landline,Susan Wloszczyna,Fresh,2017-07-21,A forlornly funny and emotionally bruising dramedy that rarely misses an opportunity to reveal humans as the flawed and occasionally awful beings that they are.

8065,m/landline,J. R. Jones,Fresh,2017-07-27,"Like [Obvious Child], this one benefits from Slate's ample charm and comic timing, though they've been funneled into a more conventional coming-of-age story."
8066,m/landline,Peter Canavese,Fresh,2017-07-26,"Slate cements her status as a kind of later-day Lucille Ball, gifted in physical comedy and possessed of a dithering combination of smarts and free-flowing emotion."

8068,m/landline,Megan Burbank,Fresh,2017-08-18,A romantic comedy that soundly rejects the allure of charismatic assholes in favor of milquetoast romance; its platonic ideal is essentially the reading-while-your-boyfriend-plays-video-games phase in a relationship.
8069,m/landline,Julia Felsenthal,Fresh,2017-07-20,"If Obvious Child offered a quick sketch of its broader universe, Landline, Robespierre, Holm, and Slate's latest collaboration, is a carefully rendered study."

8081,m/larnacoeur,Tom Dawson,Fresh,2010-07-07,"Worth seeing for Duris' athletic, charismatic and quick-witted performance, not to mention his snake-hipped recreation with Paradis of Dirty Dancing's pas de deux. And yes, he does dance like Patrick Swayze."

8083,m/larnacoeur,Matt Bochenski,Fresh,2010-07-01,"Duris and Paradis are a perfect physical match in this topsy-turvy environment -- her severe, spiky, almost-masculine features contrasting with his soft, feminine vulnerability."
8084,m/larnacoeur,Marshall Fine,Fresh,2010-09-09,"The kind of romantic comedy that Hollywood doesn't seem to know how to make anymore...a souffl of a comedy, airy and tasty at the same time."
8085,m/larnacoeur,Roger Moore,Fresh,2013-01-19,"Like ""How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days,"" only funnier, fresher. And French."
8086,m/larnacoeur,Tony Medley,Rotten,2010-09-09,"...convoluted and with inferior subtitles, a farce depends mightily on the music to frame the action and this score isn't up to the task."
8087,m/larnacoeur,Allan Hunter,Fresh,2010-07-02,"Duris keeps everything on track, oozing sex appeal and displaying a gift for physical comedy. Heartbreaker is ripe for an American remake but you pity whoever has to follow in the gossamer footsteps of quicksilver charmer Duris."

8094,m/larry_crowne,Christopher Lloyd,Fresh,2011-06-30,"Here's a movie for adults that's warm and enjoyable, but has brains and ambition. Tom Hanks directs with a soft touch but not a soft head. ""Larry Crowne"" is like fancy French toast - comfort food with a dollop of aspiration."

8100,m/larry_crowne,Mark Olsen,Rotten,2011-06-28,"With its eager-to-please congeniality, it almost works, but with a pacing that is at once comfortably assured and frustratingly slack, like holding exactly to the speed limit on a stretch of open road, Larry Crowne never quite comes to life."
8101,m/larry_crowne,Keith Cohen,Fresh,2011-06-30,"This infectiously entertaining summer movie makes you feel good. It provides hope that a fresh start is possible regardless of age. Hanks has oodles of charm, and he and Roberts have great chemistry. The real find in the acting arena is..."
8102,m/larry_crowne,Erik Childress,Fresh,2011-06-30,"With Hanks sharing screenwriting duty with Vardalos, you can almost make a game out of which characters and plot elements were of her invention and which ones he eventually smoothed out into a comedy that once it gets going is hard to stop smiling at."

8109,m/larry_crowne,Helen O'Hara,Fresh,2011-06-27,"This one coasts by on Hanks' immense appeal and charm, but more focus and a touch more sharpness are needed to make it really come alive."
8110,m/larry_crowne,Joshua Tyler,Fresh,2011-06-30,"Feel good and forget about it, that seems to be the goal of Larry Crowne, and it's something this Tom Hanks directed film accomplishes with flourish."
8111,m/larry_crowne,Pete Hammond,Fresh,2011-07-01,This charmer about late middle-aged renaissance is pertinent for these times and a perfect summer comedy for grown-ups looking to escape robots and superheroes.

8115,m/last_castle,Roger Moore,Rotten,2001-10-19,"Once you strip away the red, white and blue bunting, the film we're left with is one swell action sequence -- a prison riot -- and every prison movie cliche in the (1940s vintage) book."
8116,m/last_castle,Owen Gleiberman,Rotten,2001-10-18,"Here, as in that overheated political circus The Contender, Lurie demonstrates his weakness for heavy-handed 'topical' dialectics."

8119,m/last_castle,Norm Schrager,Fresh,2001-10-18,"Once you let the realism go (or lack of it), it's fun to see the Colonel get his just desserts, and Redford ... shows us what real heroism is all about."

8121,m/last_castle,Gary Thompson,Rotten,2001-10-18,Seems less than the sum of its parts.
8122,m/last_castle,Robin Clifford,Fresh,2001-10-18,"...a well-crafted film that works most of the way through, but gives way to the bombastic ending that detracts from the overall impact."

8124,m/last_castle,Steve Rhodes,Fresh,2001-10-19,"As the suspense builds, you'll be on the edge of your seat. And the ending, which involves the American flag, will have you wanting to stand up and cheer."

8126,m/last_castle,Desson Thomson,Rotten,2001-10-19,Devolves into a mundane warden-versus-inmate conclusion.
8127,m/last_castle,Bob Aulert,Rotten,2001-10-19,The Last Castle takes [a] timeworn premise and steers it down a ludicrous and obvious path to a conclusion that will have most audience members rolling their eyes in disbelief rather than cheering.
8128,m/last_castle,Erik Childress,Rotten,2001-10-18,A howler of a prison movie about a genital-wagging contest supported by a group of grown-up boys still longing to play with their toys in the sand.
8129,m/last_castle,Moira MacDonald,Rotten,2001-10-19,"The Last Castle, while engrossing in parts, might have benefited from more pre-shooting talk about what makes an intriguing character -- and what makes a star performance."

8131,m/last_castle,Tom Sander,Fresh,2001-10-18,"From beginning to end, there's an awful lot of Cool Hand Luke in The Last Castle."
8132,m/last_castle,Renee Scolaro Rathke,Rotten,2001-10-19,"The Last Castle will likely do very well at the box office, not because it is particulary good, but becuase, simply put, timing is everything."

8140,m/late_phases_2014,Anton Bitel,Fresh,2014-08-30,"Like Don Coscarelli's Bubba Ho-Tep (2002), Late Phases uses an old-school monster of horror to allegorise the cruelly inexorable ravages of senescence and death."
8141,m/late_phases_2014,John Gholson,Fresh,2014-09-25,There's always junk-food pleasure in seeing a questionably funky-looking werewolf take the business end of a silver-loaded shotgun to the face.
8142,m/late_phases_2014,John DeFore,Fresh,2014-11-17,"Less ambitious but more satisfyingly resolved than Bogliano's last effort, Here Comes the Devil, Late Phases is a reminder of how much monster movies rely on what happens when the monster's not on screen."
8143,m/late_phases_2014,Zachary Wigon,Fresh,2014-11-18,"The narrative ends up working in a smaller scope than one might expect given the premise of a beast plaguing a community, but the journey getting to the finish is exhilarating all the same."
8144,m/late_phases_2014,Chris Cabin,Rotten,2014-11-18,"Adrin Garca Bogliano ends up merely toying with the death-steeped concerns of his characters, and taking the furious and bitter perspective that powers the narrative's ponderous dramatic core for granted."
8145,m/late_phases_2014,Matthew Dessem,Rotten,2014-11-19,"Late Phases transforms from laughably non-frightening horror film to self-serious family drama and back again, all the while remaining ferociously, ravenously boring."
8146,m/late_phases_2014,Jeannette Catsoulis,Fresh,2014-11-20,A sprightly horror movie about finding new purpose for old bones.

8149,m/late_phases_2014,Brian Tallerico,Rotten,2014-11-21,"Damici gives his memorable protagonist enough life to hold it together more often than it would have otherwise. He's great here. The movie around him, not so much."

8151,m/late_phases_2014,Scott Weinberg,Fresh,2015-08-23,"Features some great performances, a worthwhile sense of strange humanity, and, ultimately, a handful of truly cool werewolf sequences."
8152,m/late_phases_2014,Heather Wixson,Fresh,2016-01-07,"Without a doubt, Late Phases is one of the finest lycanthrope films of the last 20 years and a shining example of great independent horror."
8153,m/late_phases_2014,Candice Frederick,Fresh,2017-09-01,"As the film leads up to its bloody conclusion, there's a sense of peace that falls upon our hero, a reparation that he is unable to find at the local church or even with his son."
8154,m/late_phases_2014,Deirdre Crimmins,Rotten,2018-08-21,Its avoidance of dealing with the horror head-on leads to too much ambiguity.
8155,m/late_phases_2014,Molly Henery,Fresh,2018-11-02,"While this is not my favorite werewolf movie, it was still well done. I appreciated the use of practical effects and it was a pretty unique storyline."
8156,m/late_phases_2014,James Clay,Rotten,2018-12-08,"This bland take on werewolves has an excellent premise and a slow burn to its pacing that had a lot of promise, but unfortunately, it wrote a few checks the script couldn't cash."
8157,m/late_phases_2014,Naila Scargill,Fresh,2019-02-28,"The inevitable showdown is a hoot, but overall, a throwaway experience that should have spent more time in development."

8358,m/life_of_david_gale,Wesley Morris,Rotten,2003-02-21,"A snide, juvenile, plot-twisting story about capital punishment that should provoke activists truly concerned about the death penalty to rage, and guilty-pleasure seekers to lament that the movie fails even as decent trash."
8359,m/life_of_david_gale,Rob Vaux,Rotten,2003-02-24,"There are few things more depressing than a bad film about an important subject. The Life of David Gale takes it one step further: it's a silly, ludicrous, utterly laughable film about a very important subject."

8367,m/life_of_david_gale,Shawn Levy,Rotten,2003-02-20,"In the end, the intelligence of the dialogue and crack acting are wrestled to the ground by the zealous politics, the formulaic narrative and a wan and flaccid air unusual from the reliably nifty Parker."

8691,m/lullaby_2013,Leah Greenblatt,Rotten,2014-12-03,"A raft of fine actors -- including Amy Adams, Richard Jenkins, and Downton Abbey's Jessica Brown Findlay -- are wasted in a sour, callow family drama that mistakes constant yelling for emotional tension and fortune-cookie aphorisms for wisdom."
8692,m/lullaby_2013,Nick Prigge,Rotten,2014-06-11,Garrett Hedlund's performance throbs with an anguish that's far more honest than the sentimental euthanasia subplot at the center of the film.

8740,m/madagascar_escape_2_africa,Charlotte O'Sullivan,Fresh,2008-12-05,"Stiller has an ear for mainstream projects that keep a few steps ahead of the crowd, like Meet the Parents and Tropic Thunder. Escape 2 Africa is tame by comparison but it never treats us like dumb animals."

8746,m/madagascar_escape_2_africa,Tasha Robinson,Fresh,2008-11-07,"The first Madagascar was surprisingly enjoyable, thanks to high energy and playfully dark material, but the returning writing-directing crew doesn't seem nearly as invested this time around."

8769,m/madman_1981,Brian Orndorf,Fresh,2015-05-24,"It doesn't reach the iconic highs of ""Friday the 13th,"" but ""Madman"" has its simple pleasures, including attention to character and an unusual interest in music to help secure its creepy intent."
8770,m/madman_1981,Ford Maddox Brown,Fresh,2016-01-31,"Fair enough, the dialogue is a bit cheesy and the characters aren't the most complex bunch of people you'll ever meet, nevertheless Madman has its stylistic accomplishments..."

8772,m/madman_1981,David Keyes,Rotten,2016-10-26,"There's nothing remotely enjoyable about the experience of Madman, which misses the opportunity to exploit unlikely punchlines and buries its situations in a compost pile of muck, boredom and insufferably miscalculated technical merits."

8812,m/mama_2013,Leah Rozen,Fresh,2013-01-17,"The fact that Guillermo del Toro is an executive producer of Mama is a tip-off that this won't be just another horror film with misbehaving and soon-to-be-dismembered teenagers or a drooling, slime-soaked monster."
8813,m/mama_2013,Michael Wilmington,Fresh,2013-01-17,"Mama is something of a throwback, and at times a stunning one."
8814,m/mama_2013,Christopher Lloyd,Fresh,2013-01-18,"The filmmakers manage that rare trick of weaving a pervasive blanket of dark mood, an almost suffocating sense of dread that sets up the boo-gotcha moments."
8815,m/mama_2013,Kevin Carr,Fresh,2013-01-18,"Had it come out last October as originally scheduled, head-to-head with Sinister, it would have been a mistake. As it is, it's a perfectly acceptable slice of January horror."

8820,m/mama_2013,Mike McCahill,Rotten,2017-09-01,"While its finale gestures at something emotional, getting there involves mucho familiar multiplex filler: loud screeches and some pretty silly business involving the girls' sinister way with wax crayons."
8821,m/mama_2013,Melissa Anderson,Rotten,2013-01-15,Mama never delivers the primal terror its premise would suggest.
8822,m/mama_2013,Beth Accomando,Fresh,2013-01-19,Mama is not a gross out horror film and it's not trying to terrorize you. But it does deliver an elegantly creepy ghost tale that might subtly insinuate itself into your nightmares.
8823,m/mama_2013,Matt Pais,Rotten,2013-01-17,"The dull, cliche-filled Mama is the kind of movie in which you don't fear the demon in the main character's bed, only envy that she gets to lay down."
8824,m/mama_2013,Dana Stevens,Rotten,2013-01-24,"Even if the beats are familiar, Muschietti sustains a remarkable mood throughout: wintry, elemental and stark, like a late Sylvia Plath poem."

8826,m/mama_2013,Margot Harrison,Fresh,2013-05-22,Maternal-instinct-versus-the-monster is such a horror cliché that it feels almost subversive to watch a movie where the protagonist is a reluctant 'mom.'

8833,m/man_about_town,David Nusair,Rotten,2007-02-11,...Binder's reliance on increasingly melodramatic elements effectively negates the film's few positive attributes...

8835,m/man_about_town,Brian Orndorf,Rotten,2007-02-14,How dense is Binder? He uses an acoustic version of Our Lips Are Sealed to underscore a tender moment Jack recalls from his childhood. Because nothing says 1976 quite like an iconic song from 1981.
8836,m/man_about_town,Scott Weinberg,Rotten,2007-03-01,Binder's made some really fine movies and some curiously weak ones; my opinion is that this one falls firmly in the latter group.

8856,m/man_of_the_house,Micheal Compton,Rotten,2019-11-18,Having Tommy Lee Jones spoof his tough guy image isn't a bad idea. Having him spoof his image in a film like Man of the House is a very bad idea.

8905,m/mansome,Jeffrey M. Anderson,Rotten,2012-05-20,"Mansome is arguably [Spurlock's] most insignificant, lightweight effort to date. Never mind that it doesn't provide any answers; it barely even asks a question."
8906,m/mansome,Marshall Fine,Fresh,2012-05-23,"Reality TV lacks Spurlock's sly willingness to let the eccentric explain themselves, rather than letting them appear foolish. It's not deep, but then, it's about vanity."

8944,m/marianne_and_leonard_words_of_love,Joe Friar,Fresh,2019-07-07,"It sounds like a Nicholas Sparks novel, but this true story of legendary folk singer Leonard Cohen and his Norwegian muse Marianne Ihlen features amazing footage, audio snippets, and interviews to tell this enduring love story. Captivating."

8965,m/marie_curie_the_courage_of_knowledge_2017,Robert Denerstein,Fresh,2017-07-18,"Anchored by Karolina Gruszka's vibrant performance, Marie Curie: The Courage of Knowledge melds a story about scientific discovery with a passionate look at the struggles of a woman whose life should have been a good deal easier than it actually was."
8966,m/mary_queen_of_scots,Richard von Busack,Rotten,2018-12-20,In college they warn you against the kind of history where things had to happen because they happened the way they happened. Thus we miss the question of what kind of plotting Mary had been up to -- real or imaginary.

8978,m/mary_queen_of_scots,Devesh Sharma,Fresh,2019-02-02,"Saoirse Ronan is the soul of film, giving her all to the project. The first half especially is quiet dull and you sit through it because Saoirse is simply brilliant...if not for the two actresses, the film easily would have fallen flat."

9074,m/mechanic_resurrection,Roger Moore,Rotten,2016-08-30,Statham is wasting his last good years as an action star in Z-movies like this.

9081,m/megamind,Catherine Jones,Fresh,2010-12-03,The film appropriates elements from Shrek and The Incredibles and produces an entertaining hybrid that should have parents chuckling with glee.

9083,m/megamind,Tasha Robinson,Fresh,2010-11-04,"There's nothing wrong with animation aimed at adults, but this may be the first kids' movie that throws fewer bones to its supposed intended viewers than to their parents."

9147,m/men_with_brooms,Christopher Null,Rotten,2002-10-22,Not completely loveable -- but what underdog movie since The Bad News Bears has been? -- but certainly hard to hate.
9148,m/men_with_brooms,David Grove,Fresh,2002-12-08,"The plot of the comeback curlers isn't very interesting actually, but what I like about Men With Brooms and what is kind of special is how the film knows what's unique and quirky about Canadians."

9234,m/midnights_children,Andrew Schenker,Rotten,2013-04-21,"Preserves much of the novel's intricacy and human drama, perhaps due to Salman Rushdie's involvement as co-screenwriter, even if it remains singularly unremarkable from a cinematic perspective."
9235,m/midnights_children,Robert Abele,Rotten,2013-05-03,"A pretty but staidly linear epic drained of the novel's larkish, metaphorical sweep, and a collection of multi-generational love stories lacking their originally eccentric, fizzy charm."

9334,m/miss_bala_2019,Juanma Fernández París,Fresh,2019-01-31,"Even though parts of the film are predictable, the cast manages to make it work and elevate the film. [Full Review in Spanish]"
9335,m/miss_bala_2019,Kim Hughes,Rotten,2019-02-01,There is absolutely room for female action stars in the contemporary film canon but Miss Bala fails to make the case.
9336,m/miss_bala_2019,Monica Castillo,Rotten,2019-02-01,"Although the new Miss Bala gives its lead character the agency to fight back and outsmart her captors, the film overdoses on its own message of pop feminist empowerment."
9337,m/miss_bala_2019,Pete Vonder Haar,Rotten,2019-02-15,It's hard to say if Hardwicke's unwillingness to ugly things up is a feature or a bug.
9338,m/miss_bala_2019,Tim Cogshell,Rotten,2019-09-18,This film suffers from its Hollywood-ization... It's all so slick.
9339,m/miss_julie_2014,Stephen Holden,Fresh,2014-12-04,"Much more convincing than Mike Figgis's 1999 screen adaptation, starring Saffron Burrows, it is a grueling slog through a hell of torment, cruelty and suffering."
9340,m/miss_julie_2014,Grant Rollings,Rotten,2016-01-01,It starts off as a will-they-won't-they as to whether Chastain's baron's daughter will sleep with Farrell. It ends up as a will-they-won't-they ever shut up. Should have been called Shouting Miss Julie.
9341,m/miss_julie_2014,Eddie Harrison,Rotten,2015-08-31,"Miss Julie feels stubbornly theatrical, rather than cinematic; Ullmann's dispassionate camera conveys little urgency or momentum, and her use of cutaways to highlight details like photographs and knives is painfully heavy-handed."
9342,m/miss_julie_2014,James Verniere,Fresh,2014-12-07,"The film's themes - sexual power, class struggle, money, gender, - are as relevant as ever."
9343,m/miss_julie_2014,Bill Brownstein,Fresh,2015-03-05,"A compelling clash of upstairs/downstairs class values, this is one of the rare examples of filmed theatre that is able to move well beyond the usual static frontiers of that genre."
9344,m/miss_julie_2014,Allie Gemmill,Rotten,2019-04-06,"Rife with mawkish histrionics and a thoroughly overwrought script, it's hard to maintain interest in what should be an intriguing watch."
9345,m/miss_julie_2014,Allen Almachar,Fresh,2020-07-17,"There are many things worth commending, one of which is the strength of the performances. But as I step back and think about it as an overall piece, I find myself overwhelmingly ... unaffected."
9346,m/miss_julie_2014,Wesley Morris,Fresh,2014-12-11,What Ullmann's done is create the ideal conditions for these three to do electrifying work with each other. She maintains control so they can lose it.
9347,m/miss_julie_2014,Abby Garnett,Rotten,2014-12-02,"Strenuously acted dramas make for strenuous viewing, and Liv Ullmann's rigorous adaptation of Strindberg's Miss Julie, which uproots the action to 19th-century Ireland, is no exception."
9348,m/miss_julie_2014,Matthew Bond,Fresh,2017-10-30,The result is decent rather than spectacular.
9349,m/miss_julie_2014,Dan Fainaru,Rotten,2014-09-09,"All the tremendous claustrophobic intensity of the original is scattered to the winds. And that will not go unnoticed by theatre lovers, who should be the immediate audience of such a film."
9350,m/miss_julie_2014,Nikola Grozdanovic,Fresh,2014-09-09,"Ullmann's version of ""Miss Julie"" exists in a special cinematic category; it's toxic, it's hypnotic, and passionately translates Strindberg's genius instinct for enlightening the multi-layered psychological spectrums of human desire for lust and power."
9351,m/miss_julie_2014,Joe McGovern,Fresh,2014-12-31,"Morton, one of the least artificial actresses in the world, charts her character's heartbreak without any of the self-pity normally assigned to ordinary women."
9352,m/miss_julie_2014,Julia Zdrojewski,Rotten,2017-03-10,"The film has a singular focus on these characters and their power struggles of class and gender, but fails to ever feel like it's really going anywhere."

9354,m/miss_julie_2014,Ryan Lattanzio,Fresh,2014-11-19,"Chastain's electrifying performance places among the great female dramatic turns in a literary tragedy, from Nina Pens Rode in 'Gertrud' to Nastassja Kinski in 'Tess' and Isabelle Huppert in 'Madame Bovary.'"

9356,m/miss_julie_2014,Dennis Harvey,Rotten,2014-09-07,"Liv Ullmann's worshipful but static adaptation of the classic Strindberg play fails to work as a film, despite impressive perfs."
9357,m/miss_julie_2014,Matt Donato,Rotten,2014-11-30,"While Farrell, Chastain, and Morton flex their theatrical muscles in entertaining ways, a 129 minute runtime proves to be bloated, exhausting, and unnecessarily drawn out."
9358,m/miss_julie_2014,Sophie WIng,Fresh,2019-05-07,"A film which aims to leave a bad taste in your mouth, for Miss Julie the question is whether that's a fatal flaw or an unrelenting examination of the ugly human heart."
9359,m/miss_meadows,Tomas Hachard,Rotten,2014-11-10,"Perhaps Karen Leigh Hopkins's intent was to subtly suggest the surreal aspects of the story, but ultimately she underplays her hand."
9360,m/miss_meadows,Brian Truitt,Rotten,2014-11-13,"It exists somewhere between serious character study and satirical fish-out-of-water story, never figuring out which it wants to be."
9361,m/miss_meadows,John Noonan,Fresh,2015-03-06,"Miss Meadows is an interesting character study of someone just trying to make the world a better place through murder, and questioning whether her methods may actually be the cause of the world's decay."
9362,m/miss_meadows,Nicholas Bell,Rotten,2019-09-12,Tonally awkward and a bit too underwhelming to fully succeed as the black comedy cum violent thriller character study it is trying to be.

9364,m/miss_meadows,Frank Scheck,Rotten,2014-11-10,"Director-screenwriter Hopkins is unsuccessful in navigating the absurd storyline's jarring tonal shifts, with the result that this kinder, gentler variation on Ms. 45 mainly emerges as off-puttingly bizarre."
9365,m/miss_meadows,Glenn Kenny,Rotten,2014-11-14,"The earnestness brings the movie from mildly irritating pastiche status to actively awful, and that is all she wrote."
9366,m/miss_meadows,Clint O'Connor,Rotten,2014-11-14,"Katie Holmes is on target, but this tone-deaf film misses the mark."
9367,m/miss_meadows,Tasha Robinson,Fresh,2014-11-17,"It's so relentlessly upbeat and deliberately artificial that it admits no cynicism or judgment, and it makes the film daringly weird."
9368,m/miss_meadows,Hayden Manders,Rotten,2017-06-28,"It's a shame the odd-for-oddball's sake of a plot had to overshadow Holmes' charming performance, for this could've been the role that kicked her relatively safe career into gear."

9371,m/miss_meadows,Mike D'Angelo,Rotten,2014-11-13,"As an ostensible work of satire, it lacks bite, never truly questioning or complicating its heroine's actions; the film isn't even outrageous enough to be appalling (which paradoxically makes it appalling)."
9372,m/miss_meadows,Dennis Harvey,Rotten,2014-11-13,"Middling ""Miss Meadows"" blends black comedy, character study and thriller elements into a mixture that doesn't quite gel, though it's watchable enough."
9373,m/miss_meadows,Prairie Miller,Fresh,2014-04-27,"Sinister sitcomish Katie Holmes does Uzi And Harriet. Suggesting a daffy while disturbing schizoid mix in this culture - at ease with exporting a blend of Hollywood and war, and a system increasingly in bed with death squads and self-righteous torture."
9374,m/miss_meadows,Todd Jorgenson,Rotten,2014-12-31,"... struggles to find a consistent tone, and doesn't offer sufficient context to give emotional resonance to a female-empowerment fantasy that ultimately feels too detached from reality."

9384,m/mission_impossible_rogue_nation,Roger Moore,Rotten,2015-07-28,"Jokey, derivative, the weakest of the MI movies, but still fun in most of the usual ways."
9385,m/mission_impossible_rogue_nation,Peter Bradshaw,Fresh,2015-07-30,"This M:I is entertaining in its schematic way; it's impossible not to respond to the theme music on a Pavlovian level.

9386,m/mission_impossible_rogue_nation,Rene Rodriguez,Fresh,2015-07-29,"For about 90 minutes or so, Rogue Nation is grandly exciting. But in the final half-hour, McQuarrie makes a critical mistake: He starts taking this enjoyable nonsense seriously."

9403,m/mobsters,Michael Sragow,Rotten,2014-05-20,It's an excuse for the latest crop of media-spawned personalities -- the male equivalent of starlets -- to invade the heavy-duty genre of the gangster film. They don't come up to Cagney's spats.
9404,m/mobsters,Roger Hurlburt,Rotten,2013-05-21,"In an attempt to find the origins of infamous gangsters Charlie ""Lucky"" Luciano, Meyer Lansky, Frank Costello and Benny ""Bugsy"" Siegel, Karbelnikoff has rendered lame caricatures instead of meaty characters."

9410,m/mobsters,Johanna Steinmetz,Rotten,2013-05-21,"Despite competent production, despite-or perhaps because of-a high and inventively mutilated body count, the film is ultimately boring."
9411,m/mobsters,Lou Cedrone,Rotten,2013-05-21,"Mobsters is a bloody little fairy tale that makes good guys out of Lucky Luciano, Frank Costello, Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lansky. According to the film, a largely plodding affair, they were just four kids who liked to kill people once in a while."

9431,m/modigliani,Lisa Nesselson,Rotten,2004-10-05,"Failing to invest famous characters with the depth to break free of a made-for-TV feel, earnest misfire does make one want to read up on the real Modigliani."
9432,m/modigliani,Bob Strauss,Rotten,2005-05-13,"Director Mick Davis shows little if any imagination in presenting the troubled genius or the remarkable Montparnasse art scene of the World War I era, and that's the real bummer."

9434,m/modigliani,Jules Brenner,Rotten,2005-05-04,A third of it is an episodically disordered string of scenes that coalesce into a narrative. The remaining two thirds is melodrama.

9436,m/modigliani,Matt McKillop,Rotten,2005-05-11,Modigliani's problems lie in its contentment with superficial clichs
9437,m/modigliani,Carina Chocano,Rotten,2005-05-12,"Modigliani may have been noted for his drunken volatility and arrogance, but once you get a dozen years or so of Behind the Musics and E! True Hollywood Stories behind you, it's hard to get worked up about that sort of thing anymore."
9438,m/modigliani,Ken Fox,Rotten,2005-07-01,"The real-life Modigliani did indeed live a short, tragic life, but this factually inaccurate, plodding film makes it feel twice as long."
9439,m/moms_night_out,Bilge Ebiri,Rotten,2014-05-11,"If the concept of a moms' night out is premised on the notion that mothers can never get away for fear their families will collapse in their absence, then this movie cruelly confirms that fear."

9461,m/monsieur_lazhar_2011,Bob Mondello,Fresh,2012-04-13,"Fellag, a comedian and himself an exile from Algeria, makes Lazhar both a sensitive and an amusing figure. And the kids are just terrific, especially Emilien Neron as a boy who carries the guilt of the whole school on his shoulders."
9462,m/monsieur_lazhar_2011,Jesse Cataldo,Rotten,2012-04-08,"There's great potential for the kind of issues that are taken on, but nothing is resolved, and the biggest questions, of guilt and shame, the gulf of understanding between the first world and the third, remain unengaged."
9463,m/monsieur_lazhar_2011,Austin Kennedy,Fresh,2012-05-12,"This is a good movie about teaching, but more importantly, a good movie about the loss of a loved one and how to cope with death."
9464,m/monsieur_lazhar_2011,Joe Morgenstern,Fresh,2012-04-12,"What makes the film enthralling is the wisdom and grace with which it addresses the twin subjects of grief and healing, and the quiet beauty of Mohamed Fellag's performance in the title role."

9475,m/monsieur_lazhar_2011,Pat Padua,Fresh,2018-08-30,"[Philippe] Falardeau's unobtrusive direction, and the restrained performance of Fellag and the child actors, make this a powerful, unsentimental film that doesn't make you feel like you're hearing a lecture."
9476,m/monsieur_lazhar_2011,Simon Foster,Fresh,2012-06-07,"Falardeau's adaptation of fellow Québécois Evelyne de la Chenelière's play honours the power of the written word (a motif reinforced throughout the film), and expands on its stage origins via remarkably-assured cinematic touches."

9484,m/monsters_and_men,Trey Mangum,Fresh,2018-10-25,'Monsters and Men' will go down as a Black Lives Matter film that upended the format and presented us with a direct mirror as to what black and brown folks feel during this pivotal and crucial time in our society.
9485,m/monsters_and_men,Robert Abele,Fresh,2018-09-27,"Its innate intelligence and matter-of-fact sensitivity are the kinds of storytelling assets we need more of, especially when the fabric of life for many continues to fray and tear in ways that demand a larger societal reassessing."
9486,m/monsters_and_men,Mark Dujsik,Fresh,2018-09-27,"It's not simply about doing the right thing from one point of view. It's in realizing that, for each of the men, the right thing is different."

9490,m/monsters_and_men,Marjorie Baumgarten,Fresh,2018-10-04,"Despite its many loose ends and overblown title, Monsters and Men is a memorable first film that has an air of having wafted in from the streets. Infused with tenderness and humanity, Green's film ultimately encourages empathy and understanding."
9491,m/monsters_and_men,Neal Pollack,Fresh,2020-01-29,"Monsters And Men will convert no one, because it's hard to care about anyone in the frame."
9492,m/monsters_and_men,Peter Travers,Fresh,2018-09-28,"John David Washington is at his forceful best in this racially-charged drama from debuting filmmaker Reinaldo Marcus Green that uses the perspective of three persons of color to examine the shooting of an unarmed black man by a white cop,"
9493,m/monsters_and_men,Chris Bumbray,Fresh,2018-09-07,Well acted and compassionate.
9494,m/monsters_and_men,Aine O'Connor,Fresh,2019-01-22,The plot evolves through the three stories but despite the subject it focuses less on outrage and more on the moral aspects of doing the right thing. I loved it.
9495,m/monsters_and_men,Rosalynn Try-Hane,Fresh,2019-01-15,"A smart and refreshing look at the race, masculinity and police brutality in 2018 - do the right thing and see this film."

9510,m/morgan_2016,Randall Colburn,Fresh,2016-08-29,"There's something nostalgic about Morgan, not in its technology or direction, both of which are aggressively modern, but in its structure."
9511,m/morgan_2016,Jesse Hassenger,Fresh,2016-09-01,"It would be a stretch to call the movie any kind of feminist statement, but it does boast an equal-opportunity nastiness alongside its enjoyable stupidities."
9512,m/morgan_2016,Andrea Chase,Rotten,2016-08-31,"A high-minded film that wants us all to ponder what it means to be human. Alas, the most ponder-worthy thing in this film is wondering how Kate Mara managed to do all that running through the piney woods in those very high heels."
9513,m/morgan_2016,Stephen Schaefer,Fresh,2016-09-02,"As yet another riff on Frankenstein and those overreaching scientists who want to play God, Morgan offers dread, androgyny, gore and violence but no magic."

9519,m/morgan_2016,Peter Hartlaub,Rotten,2016-08-31,"Scott's pacing, building an early foundation of uneasiness, starts to collapse as the script resorts to illogical actions in service of the plot."
9520,m/morgan_2016,Simon Foster,Fresh,2016-11-15,"Alex Garland's 2015 cult hit Ex Machina, with Alicia Vikander as the robo-girl, trod similar ground; it proved more intellectually ambitious, though Morgan is a dash more fun."
9521,m/morgan_2016,Cheryl Eddy,Rotten,2017-03-13,"Morgan is not as boundary-pushing as it could have been -- it's nowhere near as original as last year's Ex Machina, which explored similar themes but felt completely fresh in a way that Morgan doesn't."

9534,m/mortal_kombat,Kim Newman,Fresh,2010-04-07,Anderson does a good job of edging humour into dumbness - Lambert gets a few witty looks - and the art direction and effects are okay.

9537,m/mortal_kombat,Gene Siskel,Fresh,2020-09-14,The only decent video game turned into a movie. Why? Obviously because the filmmakers have really tried to offer some eye-popping visuals that can provide the same stimuli as the video game itself.

9544,m/mother_night,Roger Ebert,Rotten,2000-01-01,"Does the film work? Not really. It loses itself in comic caricatures of the loonies that Campbell meets in New York; and its melodramatic double-reverses, by making the plot seem arbitrary, rob it of importance."

9566,m/mr_holmes,Geoffrey Macnab,Fresh,2015-02-12,"What makes it progressively more moving is a complex, multi-layered script and the performance from Sir Ian, which is reminiscent of Victor Sjstrm in Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries as another old man looking back on his life."
9567,m/mr_holmes,Jeff Beck,Rotten,2015-11-09,"Despite a brilliant performance from Sir Ian McKellen, Mr. Holmes is a little too scattered in its plot to leave much of an impact, making you wish that there had been more focus on its intriguing mystery and less on the less satisfying parts of the tale."

9575,m/mr_holmes,Peter Calder,Fresh,2016-05-05,"The story is an intricate puzzle though never even slightly difficult to follow. But in the end, it's a testament to the process of writing as a way of coming to terms with one's past, and a celebration of the redemptive power of fiction."

9601,m/mrs_brown,Roger Ebert,Fresh,2000-01-01,"Mrs. Brown' is a love story about two strong-willed people who find exhilaration in testing each other. It is not about sexual love, or even romantic love, really, but about that kind of love based on challenge and fascination."

9608,m/mrs_brown,Tom Meek,Fresh,2000-01-01,"Even as the historical and emotional incongruities threaten to derail the film, the acerbic and witty prose gives Mrs. Brown a humorous dimension that, at times, makes it feel like an English response to Ridicule."

9618,m/mrs_henderson_presents,Jeff Vice,Rotten,2005-12-24,Mrs. Henderson Presents does present opportunities for Dench to point her nose in the air. But then the film loses track of her character to an extent and begins concentrating on others that are less interesting.
9619,m/mrs_henderson_presents,William Arnold,Fresh,2006-01-12,"The film may be as slick as a snake-oil salesman, but you have to have a very hard heart indeed not to find it irresistible: It's funny, touching and crammed to the rafters with clever dialogue, splashy production numbers and stiff-upper-lip charm."
9620,m/mrs_henderson_presents,Laura Clifford,Fresh,2005-12-08,"Dench keeps a lid on her performance, not pushing the comedy over the top, so that behavior that would seem cutely impish in another has the more appealing sparkle of subverted refinement."

9625,m/mrs_henderson_presents,Jeff Strickler,Fresh,2006-01-12,"Dench's Oscar-worthy performance is a delight. She turns Mrs. Henderson into a cross between the stereotypical little old lady and a hurricane. As Guest's character discovers, you've got to love her even as she's steamrolling you."
9626,m/mrs_henderson_presents,Gene Seymour,Fresh,2005-12-09,Stephen Frears seems constitutionally incapable of making an uninteresting movie.

9928,m/national_lampoons_vacation,Richard Rayner,Rotten,2006-06-24,"The result is not so much a comedy about American values as a 2,500 mile skid on a banana skin. The visual gags come thick and fast, and are about as subtly signposted as the exit markers on a freeway."

9954,m/national_security,Eric Harrison,Rotten,2003-01-17,Its acrimonious message lies in the way it depicts black oversensitivity and an atmosphere of political correctness as the only obstacles to harmony.
9955,m/national_security,Chuck Wilson,Rotten,2003-01-16,"It's not really clear what's being stolen or why, but reason isn't as important to the screen writing team of Jay Scherick and David Ronn as getting to the next car chase."

9962,m/never_say_never_again,Nick Rogers,Rotten,2012-11-11,"Can we just consider 1983 a lost year for James Bond? First, ""Octopussy,"" then Sean Connery's return in a depressing dilution of the 007 brand - one that ends with a fourth wall-breaking wink indicative less of arch fun, more of bored indifference."
9963,m/never_say_never_again,Neil Smith,Rotten,2012-10-23,"The slick production values impress and Barbara Carrera and Klaus Maria Brandauer are good value villains, but Irvin Kershner appears to have nodded off in the director's chair."

9976,m/never_say_never_again,Roxanne T. Mueller,Fresh,2017-12-30,"Essentially, it's a remake of the less successful Thunderball, also with Connery. but Never Say Never Again, in the original Bond spirit, concentrates on the people rather than the gadgets -- at least for the first half."
9977,m/never_say_never_again,Leo Goldsmith,Fresh,2005-03-22,"Aside from some minor flaws, the film is a surprisingly standard Bond film, one that could easily be integrated into the ""official"" franchise with very few adjustments."
9978,m/never_say_never_again,Mike Massie,Rotten,2020-09-06,"It may be Bond, but without the use of the gun barrel graphics, the booming theme music, and the opening title silhouettes of nude figures, it just doesn't feel the same."
9979,m/never_say_never_again,Variety Staff,Fresh,2008-10-13,"After a 12-year hiatus, Sean Connery is back in action as James Bond. The new entry marks something of a retreat from the far-fetched technology of many of the later Bonds in favor of intrigue and romance."

9993,m/next_day_air,Tom Long,Rotten,2009-05-08,"First-time feature director Benny Boom and writer Blair Cobbs get a lot of help from their cast, and the banter is often akin to a thug Three Stooges routine. But blood and predictability sour things in the end."
9994,m/next_day_air,Joshua Starnes,Rotten,2011-04-20,"Next Day Air is well-intentioned but ill-thought, an amateur work by a first time filmmaking team trying to make the kind of film they like to watch, but ignorant of what makes those kinds of films work."

10126,m/novitiate,Avi Offer,Fresh,2017-10-29,"A provocative, emotionally resonant, and powerful drama. Melissa Leo gives a commanding, tour de force performance. Margaret Qualley is radiant."
10127,m/novitiate,Mike D'Angelo,Fresh,2017-10-26,"Betts appears to have started out with a rather mundane idea and then stumbled, over the course of her research, onto something much more fruitful. The result is as intriguing and frustrating as that suggests."
10128,m/novitiate,José Martín,Fresh,2018-04-03,A most recommendable film. [Full review in Spanish]
10129,m/novitiate,Roger Moore,Fresh,2017-10-17,"Overlong...dramatically a mixed-bag, but moving."
10130,m/novitiate,Kerry Lengel,Fresh,2017-11-09,"The film raises interesting questions, but the answers remain elusive, and whether that makes for a compelling cinematic experience is entirely in the eye of the beholder."
10131,m/novitiate,Michael Ordoña,Fresh,2017-10-27,"Intense nuns-in-training drama has language, sensuality."
10132,m/novitiate,Susan G. Cole,Rotten,2017-09-07,"Though it's shot beautifully, Novitiate's pacing, focusing on the sisters' daily routines, is slow."
10133,m/novitiate,Erika W. Smith,Fresh,2017-10-27,"It's hard to imagine a film that more thoroughly passes the Bechdel Test than Novitiate, a period drama about nuns coming to terms with the changes Vatican II brought to the Catholic Church in the 1960s."
10134,m/novitiate,Susan Granger,Fresh,2017-11-14,"The anguish of Margaret Qualley is riveting, and Melissa Leo delivers a powerhouse performance in this solemn, soulful melodrama, pulling back the curtain on the secrecy of convent life."
10135,m/novitiate,Steven Prokopy,Fresh,2020-05-19,"Novitiate is filled with wonderful young actresses who are given the chance to create complex and complicated characters, with unique issues and personalities."
10136,m/novitiate,Clayton Davis,Fresh,2017-10-24,"Flaunting an all-star cast of impeccable actresses, Betts intrigues the viewer to surrender to the film's intoxicating tale of obedience and self-discovery. It's one of the year's most vivid dramas."
10137,m/novitiate,John Urbancich,Fresh,2017-11-27,First-time writer/director Maggie Betts mostly manages to involve viewers in exploring why young ladies actually might want to take the spiritual plunge.
10138,m/novitiate,Richard Brody,Rotten,2017-10-23,"Betts ... undercuts the characters' passion and transcendent devotion with audiovisual commonplaces, familiar acting styles, and a merely anecdotal narrative."
10139,m/novitiate,Mark Dujsik,Fresh,2017-11-03,The inner lives and spiritual struggles of Catholic nuns are examined in Novitiate.
10140,m/novitiate,Anna Storm,Rotten,2017-10-27,A strong premise and protagonist can't fully elevate this tale about teen nuns.
10141,m/novitiate,Armond White,Rotten,2017-11-03,"Novitiate is a scandalous, shameless anti-Catholic freak show."
10142,m/novitiate,Aubrey Page,Fresh,2017-10-27,"Stern on the surface, yet entirely human look at religion, femininity and faith."
10143,m/novitiate,Kenneth Turan,Fresh,2017-10-26,"Questions of faith may sound dry but they often make for intensely dramatic, even pulse-pounding cinema. ""Novitiate"" is the latest case in point."
10144,m/novitiate,Courtney Howard,Fresh,2017-11-04,"Deeply enthralling, it's as provocative as it is progressive."
10145,m/novitiate,Sophie Monks Kaufman,Fresh,2017-09-13,"Narratively speaking, there are no climaxes, no anti-climaxes, just a methodical commitment to establishing the context of one big question: can a woman live without physical love?"
10146,m/obvious_child,Graham Young,Fresh,2015-01-05,An independent film with characters you'll care about as well as a rare silver screen attempt to at least begin to try to understand the nature of abortion.

10148,m/obvious_child,Scott Bowles,Rotten,2014-06-05,"A dark romantic comedy that has plenty of the first, a little of the second and none of third."
10149,m/obvious_child,Genevieve Koski,Fresh,2014-06-05,"A well-realized, straight-ahead rom-com, one with the potential to reinvigorate a genre that's been flagging for decades."
10150,m/obvious_child,Chris Hewitt,Fresh,2014-06-12,The humor gets dark but the future looks bright for Robespierre and Slate.
10151,m/obvious_child,Michael Phillips,Fresh,2014-06-12,"Moment to moment, you believe what's happening in Robespierre's film, which is funny and rueful in roughly equal measure without being despairing in the slightest."
10152,m/obvious_child,Mick LaSalle,Fresh,2014-06-12,The movie doesn't present itself as some kind of secular equivalent of a moral lesson. It's not callous or weepy or preachy - or self-consciously not those things. It's a naturally told story.
10153,m/obvious_child,Robert Levin,Fresh,2014-06-06,Jenny Slate demonstrates the gift that sets apart the great actors from the good ones: The ability to move you to tears without saying a word.
10154,m/obvious_child,Richard Propes,Fresh,2020-09-18,A film that is confidently vulnerable and genuinely honest while acknowledging the masks that we so easily wear in our daily lives.
10155,m/obvious_child,Gary Thompson,Fresh,2014-06-20,"Director Gillian Robespierre arranges this as slice-of-single-life comedy, and it works well ..."
10156,m/obvious_child,Jordan Hoffman,Fresh,2018-01-04,"Beyond the identity politics and humor, Obvious Child goes the extra mile to represent a seldom voiced, moderate position about a hot button topic."
10157,m/obvious_child,Erik Childress,Fresh,2014-01-25,This film deserves to be seen as a major breakthrough for Jenny Slate who commands the kind of humor and honesty that stars possess.
10158,m/obvious_child,Jeff Meyers,Fresh,2014-06-25,It zigs when you expect it to zag.
10159,m/obvious_child,Ty Burr,Fresh,2014-06-12,"""Obvious Child"" is being promoted as a groundbreaking topical comedy about abortion. But it's less than that. And more. And, basically, not."
10160,m/obvious_child,Kelly Vance,Fresh,2014-07-02,"A prime example of what ""indie"" means, mid-2014."
10161,m/obvious_child,J. R. Jones,Rotten,2014-06-12,"The heroine can't seem to come up with any material that doesn't involve bodily functions; she never goes near the subject of motherhood, which proves that the filmmakers are scared to death of their own story."
10162,m/obvious_child,Scott Marks,Fresh,2015-01-05,"Hats off to any film that tries (and succeeds) at presenting challenging, off-putting characters from whose palms I'm reluctantly persuaded to eat."
10163,m/obvious_child,Rochelle Siemienowicz,Fresh,2014-10-03,"The sisterhood is here and seeing it at work, getting on with the business of living, is actually very moving."

10166,m/octopussy,David Hogan,Rotten,2019-01-27,"The very worst Roger Moore Bond Film, and one to avoid unless you really have to watch every single film in a marathon, like myself, sadly..."
10167,m/octopussy,Nick Rogers,Rotten,2012-10-13,"James Bond is old. Wrinkled-forehead old. Lecherous-coot old. Strategic-hairstyle old. Senior meal-discount old. Simply ... old. That's the biggest takeaway from Roger Moore's second-worst outing as 007, hot on the heels of his second-best."
10168,m/octopussy,James Berardinelli,Rotten,2000-01-01,"There's a fine line between wit and absurdity, and this particular movie too often falls on the wrong side."
10169,m/octopussy,Richard Corliss,Rotten,2008-10-13,"Bond had degenerated into a male model, and something of a genial anachronism."
10170,m/octopussy,Dennis Schwartz,Rotten,2009-02-19,Bottom-drawer Bond.
10171,m/octopussy,Debbie Barham,Rotten,2001-09-11,The joy of a great Bond movie is the way it pushes the limits of believability -- and knows when to stop. Octopussy fails.
10172,m/octopussy,Scott Nash,Rotten,1983-06-10,Octopussy is a very minor entry in the Bond franchise.
10173,m/octopussy,Ian Nathan,Fresh,2008-10-13,"One for the die hards. The saving grace here is a knowing sense of humour so lacking in its predecessor, For Your Eyes Only."
10174,m/octopussy,Austin Kennedy,Rotten,2012-10-28,"Octopussy features 2 stand-out action sequences but for the most part, it's an overlong, sluggish, and schizophrenic entry in the Bond series."
10175,m/octopussy,Alex Sandell,Rotten,2003-12-25,"I've never been a big fan of this Bond flick. Catchy name, though."
10176,m/octopussy,PJ Nabarro,Rotten,2019-10-31,The naffness that was prevalent in the Bond series around the time of Moore still abounds here.
10177,m/octopussy,John J. Puccio,Rotten,2000-01-01,...more than a bit silly compared to its immediate predecessor.
10178,m/octopussy,Rob Vaux,Fresh,2002-08-12,Great Bond. Lousy title.
10179,m/octopussy,Bob Thomas,Fresh,2018-10-17,"""Octopussy"" is the 13th of the James Bond movies, and it is one of the best."
10180,m/octopussy,Mike Massie,Fresh,2020-09-06,"For the first time in the series, the story unfolds like a true mystery, instead of merely having some eccentric billionaire devising a plot to take over the world."
10181,m/octopussy,Steve Rhodes,Rotten,2000-01-01,Too long
10182,m/octopussy,Vincent Canby,Fresh,2004-08-30,Makes no pretense of being based on anything except the Ian Fleming character and the high good humor and wit of the film makers.

10184,m/octopussy,Jeffrey M. Anderson,Rotten,2014-05-05,More sexual innuendo than usual in provocatively named film.
10185,m/octopussy,David Parkinson,Rotten,2015-10-06,This was the 13th Bond movie and it's possibly the most frivolous in the series to date (it's certainly the most careless).
10186,m/offence,Dennis Schwartz,Fresh,2000-01-01,The film was in some ways spoiled but not ruined by the pretentiously arty way it was directed by Sidney Lumet.
10187,m/offence,Film4 Staff,Fresh,2003-05-24,"Although the story has become a staple of films and TV police dramas since this, it still hasn't been done quite so well."
10188,m/offence,Vincent Canby,Fresh,2005-05-09,It's highly theatrical -- perhaps just a little too highly theatrical for the more or less realistic context -- but it's been staged by Lumet for maximum effect.
10189,m/offence,Chuck O'Leary,Fresh,2005-09-21,A fascinating and intense psychological thriller. This is one Connery fans should seek out.
10190,m/offence,Tom Milne,Fresh,2006-01-26,"Embedded in a 'realistic' police scene, dialogue and situations now have a ring of arty melodrama. Fascinating, nevertheless, with outstanding performances from Connery and (especially) Bannen."
10191,m/offence,Variety Staff,Rotten,2011-04-04,"There's a powerful confrontation of authority and accused between police sergeant Sean Connery and suspected child molester Ian Bannen in Sidney Lumet's The Offence. A brilliant scene, however, does not in itself make for a brilliant overall feature."
10192,m/offence,Lewis Porteous,Fresh,2015-04-16,The Offence presents audiences with an overwhelmingly bleak rumination on evil.
10193,m/offence,Wendy Ide,Fresh,2015-05-12,The third collaboration between Sean Connery and the director Sidney Lumet is an unsettling glimpse into the toxic mind of a policeman who has been polluted by the horrors witnessed over the course of his career.
10194,m/offence,Christopher Hudson,Rotten,2015-05-12,A great disappointment.
10195,m/offence,Richard Schickel,Rotten,2015-05-12,"Lumet's direction strives to give to material that is neither edifying nor suspenseful a fake profundity, stretching it to unconscionable lengths."
10196,m/offence,David Parkinson,Fresh,2015-05-12,Gritty police programmes are now so much a part of the TV landscape that it is hard to realise that a feature like The Offence once packed quite a punch.
10197,m/offence,Fernando F. Croce,Fresh,2015-05-12,This unrelentingly somber policier inaugurates a newfound force in Lumet's work.
10198,m/official_secrets,Andrew Lapin,Fresh,2019-08-29,"As the Iraq War recedes into our rear-view mirror and our current news cycle spins blindly from one world crisis to another, films like Official Secrets, bland as they may seem, will serve as crucial efforts to keep our past mistakes in our minds."
10199,m/official_secrets,Paul Whitington,Fresh,2019-10-20,"Silly thriller music is occasionally resorted to, but not necessary: this is a story that tells itself."
10200,m/official_secrets,Sarah Ksiazek,Fresh,2019-09-13,"With a stellar cast, this true story is brought to life and illuminates one of the important whistleblowers of modern times."
10201,m/official_secrets,Ryan Gilbey,Rotten,2019-10-24,"Gavin Hood's Official Secrets isn't a poor film so much as an unremarkable one, and if there is any suspense or stylistic innovation to be wrung from this important story then the director is keeping it under his hat."
10202,m/official_secrets,Philip Martin,Fresh,2019-09-20,"It should be said that all the actors do well here. And the screenplay is responsible and economical in boiling down the complex issues the movie tackles. It's a fair, understated film about things we ought to care about."
10203,m/official_secrets,Roger Tennis,Fresh,2019-09-05,The revealing 'Official Secrets' is intelligent entertainment.
10204,m/official_secrets,Roger Moore,Fresh,2019-08-28,"A bit slow, but utterly engrossing thanks to its subject and an A-list Brit cast."
10205,m/official_secrets,Peter Bradshaw,Fresh,2019-10-18,There's something interestingly tough and forthright about this slow-burner from director and co-writer Gavin Hood.
10206,m/official_secrets,David Rooney,Fresh,2019-01-29,"A straightforward, solidly old-fashioned slice of real-life espionage, journalistic and legal intrigue that gets the job done in engrossing, clear-eyed fashion even if it lacks much in the way of stylistic verve."
10207,m/official_secrets,Prairie Miller,Fresh,2019-08-29,"Yet another instance of filmmakers of courage and conviction stepping up where unfortunately and unlike Gun, politicians and the press (including critics) fear to tread. Which is the reason you likely never heard of this best female action hero this year."
10208,m/official_secrets,Robin Clifford,Fresh,2019-09-19,"The telling of this true story is a straightforward, almost perfunctory, procedural"
10209,m/official_secrets,Ann Hornaday,Fresh,2019-09-04,"Although Knightley's Gun often seems to be a passive figure, buffeted by the machinations of those around her, the film's honesty about the enormous personal costs of whistleblowing is a welcome relief from more romanticized heroics."
10210,m/official_secrets,Christy Lemire,Fresh,2019-09-03,"[A] very solid, totally respectable, well-cast, well-acted, slow burn political thriller potboiler."

10213,m/official_secrets,Brad Wheeler,Fresh,2019-09-10,"The end result is a professionally made film that is whistle-blowingly relevant, starring an excellent actress who successfully comes in from her Pride & Prejudice past."
10214,m/official_secrets,Danny Leigh,Fresh,2019-10-16,Hood knows how to crank the tension and a certain fury ticks under the story.
10215,m/official_secrets,Stephen A. Russell,Fresh,2020-08-15,"And without spoiling too much, if you think the cries of war criminal lobbed at Blair, Bush and Howard are lefty hysteria, the powerful courtroom finale is a timely reminder where that accusation comes from."

10223,m/on-the-bowery-1957,Matthew Lucas,Fresh,2019-08-06,"Feels real, even amid the sometimes awkward non-professional performances. Rogosin masterfully tells the untold stories of the people society left behind."
10224,m/on-the-bowery-1957,J. R. Jones,Fresh,2012-02-16,"On the Bowery runs only 65 minutes, but by the end you can feel skid row in your bones."

Yet no one on screen asks for pity."
10229,m/on-the-bowery-1957,James Verniere,Fresh,2011-02-04,"Shot on Manhattan's virtually resurrected street of broken persons, the film is a snapshot of gin mills, flophouses and human wrecks, once known as ""winos"" for their addiction to cheap, fortified wine."
10230,m/on-the-bowery-1957,Bosley Crowther,Rotten,2007-03-20,This is a temperance lecture on film that makes no new points.

10232,m/on-the-bowery-1957,David Sterritt,Fresh,2016-02-28,"The result is harrowing and heartrending, and all the more so when you realize that the people on the screen died mostly miserable deaths, with only this little-known work of art to memorialize them."
10233,m/on-the-bowery-1957,Nora Lee Mandel,Fresh,2010-09-23,"Fascinating for urban and film historians, but also a moving tribute to film's timeless power to illuminate social issues. See with new The Perfect Team:The Making of."

As a depiction of men at the bottom of their lives, it has the same sorrowful, accusatory force as a great Depression-era photograph by Dorothea Lange or Walker Evans."
10236,m/on-the-bowery-1957,Kenneth Turan,Fresh,2011-01-20,This landmark documentary disturbs and compels as much today in a new 35mm restoration as it did when it opened in 1956 to both criticism and acclaim.

10289,m/ongbak,Tom Keogh,Rotten,2005-02-11,"Jaa's screen time is largely about athletics, not building a character."
10290,m/ongbak,Kerry Lengel,Rotten,2005-03-03,"Jaa's moves are impressive, but the choreography ranges from bland to ridiculous (as when one dirty fighter resorts to using major appliances as weapons)."
10291,m/ongbak,Ken Fox,Fresh,2005-02-11,"The meat of the matter is fight sequences, and rather than being goosed with now-common digital effects and Hong Kong-style wirework, it's all real and all breathtaking."
10292,m/ongbak,George Wu,Fresh,2005-02-17,"The only reason to see it is for the action. In that arena, on a scale from 1 to 10, it's a 20."
10293,m/ongbak,Bob Strauss,Fresh,2005-02-11,"The movie's strong points are its clever chase sequences, in which Jaa outruns (or levitates over) gangs of murderous baddies through obstacle courses of everyday Bangkok commerce and street traffic."

10335,m/our_nixon,Lou Lumenick,Fresh,2013-08-30,"Mundane movies of events like the president's daughter's wedding and his groundbreaking trip to China are juxtaposed with Nixon's rants about his enemies and the ""homosexuals"" he believed were leading the US into decline."
10336,m/our_nixon,Dorothy Rabinowitz,Fresh,2013-07-26,"This highly personal view of the Nixon years is, for obvious reasons, a sad and wrenching one-a film that is nonetheless filled with spirit, humor and a bountiful sense of irony."

10350,m/our_nixon,A.A. Dowd,Fresh,2013-08-29,The results are akin to seeing the Nixon presidency through the eyes of his top aides; it's as much a portrait of innocence lost as a behind-closed-doors expos.

10363,m/outlaw,Derek Elley,Fresh,2007-03-12,Both the pic's power and its problems stem from Love deliberately taking no moral position nor offering any solutions; he gives his audience what it wants at a gut level and doesn't wimp out at the end.

10582,m/persona,Robert Kotlowitz,Fresh,2020-08-04,"This original and individual work acts upon us in its own way; what is finally impossible to escape are the faces of Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann, agonized objects of Bergman's worship."
10583,m/persona,Dave Kehr,Rotten,2007-07-30,"Ingmar Bergman's best film, I suppose, though it's still fairly tedious and overloaded with avant-garde cliches."
10584,m/persona,Moira Sullivan,Fresh,2003-09-30,"[Persona] is persistently compelling, primarily due to its contemplative thematic structure, partially devoid of language that allows the spectator to inscribe meaning."
10585,m/persona,David Wilson,Fresh,2018-02-08,"Certainly Persona is Bergman's most concentrated work, in a sense a summation of the themes dominant in most of his previous films; and it is undeniably a difficult film, if only because it leaves itself open to so many interpretations."

10597,m/philip_roth_unmasked,Sam Adams,Fresh,2013-03-14,"Sticking to what's on the page pays off, especially with regard to Roth's undervalued late novels, but also means he has [the filmmakers] just where he wants them."
10598,m/philip_roth_unmasked,Kyle Smith,Rotten,2013-03-15,Frustratingly little light is shed on either Roth's life or his work by this series of interviews with the novelist and a curious selection of admirers.
10599,m/philip_roth_unmasked,Tom Beer,Fresh,2013-04-01,"It's great to see extensive interview footage with the relaxed and funny author, but Philip Roth: Unmasked shies away from controversy and, as a result, feels a bit sanitized."
10600,m/philip_roth_unmasked,Troy Patterson,Rotten,2013-04-01,"That neither Krauss nor anyone has anything remotely unflattering to say about the subject points to the fundamental dishonesty of the work, which extends from its excessive reverence."

10604,m/pied_piper,J. Hoberman,Fresh,2007-11-14,"A dark and smoky affair that, although set in Germany during the Black Death summer of 1349, suggests something brainstormed in a St. Marks Place head shop."
10605,m/pied_piper,Dan Callahan,Rotten,2008-06-07,Jacques Demy's version of The Pied Piper is as distanced and uncertain as his masterpiece The Young Girls of Rochefort is ecstatically sure of itself.

10608,m/pinero,Cynthia Fuchs,Fresh,2002-01-25,"For all the film's spectacle, its visual flash and approximation of street 'realism,' its most daring aspect is its willingness to represent Piero as a vicious, frightened thug."
10609,m/pinero,Chris Hewitt,Rotten,2002-04-18,"It attempts to champion the phony theme that poor, vulnerable artists should be forgiven their failings because they are so much more important than the rest of us."

10612,m/pinero,Derek Adams,Rotten,2006-02-09,"Flashily but irritatingly shot, full of unmotivated switches from colour to b/w, sudden flashbacks, mannered slow mo and jump cuts, this is hardly a subtle evocation of its subject's life."
10613,m/pinero,Michael Dequina,Rotten,2002-01-03,"Bratt's fast-talking, all-attitude interpretation is showboating without soul--which can be said of the entire movie."
10614,m/pinero,Terry Lawson,Rotten,2002-05-03,Bratt's performance is as steady and consistent as the film is frustrating.
10615,m/pinero,Rene Rodriguez,Rotten,2002-01-24,A biopic that is as messy as the life it details.
10616,m/pinero,Frank Ochieng,Fresh,2002-01-14,"Overall, Ichaso's mosaic of a celebrated misfit has the potential moodiness to resonate as something engagingly reflective."
10617,m/pinero,Rita Kempley,Rotten,2002-01-25,This character was an abusive swine. Perhaps it would be best to let his art stand on its own.
10618,m/pinero,Rod Armstrong,Rotten,2002-01-06,Too scattered and problem-riddled to ever do its subject justice.
10619,m/pinero,Amy Bracken Sparks,Fresh,2002-06-28,"Benjamin Bratt, the pretty boy once seen on the arm of America's sweetheart Julia Roberts, plays Piero with a passion. It's a star-making performance."
10620,m/pinero,Rex Reed,Fresh,2001-12-06,Benjamin Bratt's harrowing and electric performance anchors Pinero in place as the wayward narrative jumps from one time period to the next.
10621,m/pinero,Frank Swietek,Rotten,2001-12-24,"The deliberately lackadaisical, almost improvisational approach occasionally achieves striking moments, but mostly seems more flat and redundant."
10622,m/pinero,Ken Fox,Fresh,2001-12-13,"Offers a highly impressionistic portrait of this self-described 'junkie Christ,' played with riveting intensity by Benjamin Bratt."
10623,m/pinero,Peter Keough,Rotten,2002-03-24,"Bratt's feline elegance, arrogance, and melancholy can't compensate for Ichaso's lack of restraint."
10624,m/pinero,Dave White,Fresh,2001-12-06,"What makes this one different, and therefore MUCH better, is that it avoids the typical 'this happened and then this happened' structure that makes most biographical films such heavy lifting."

10639,m/planes_fire_and_rescue,David Medsker,Rotten,2014-07-17,"The rule for animated films should be that a good joke for adults is one that is both funny and can be explained to children. Here, we have a female airplane talking about her rack. John Lasseter, I expect more from you than that."
10640,m/planes_fire_and_rescue,Linda Barnard,Fresh,2014-07-17,"For the most part, Planes: Fire & Rescue is more about chuckles than big guffaws, coupled with thrilling 3-D flight and firefighting action scenes and lessons about friendship, respect and loyalty."
10641,m/planes_fire_and_rescue,Laura Clifford,Fresh,2014-07-17,"Gannaway and his animators have done a great job illustrating the dangers and logistics of mountain set fire fighting (the fires themselves are photo realistic), but one wonders how much of this will be understood by the demographic the film is aimed at"

11793,m/saw_4,Owen Gleiberman,Rotten,2007-10-31,"The reports of torture porn's demise may have been greatly exaggerated, but this fourth entry in the mutilate-yourself-or-die series joins what may be the worst genre of the decade: the lamely ''sympathetic'' serial-killer backstory."
11794,m/saw_4,Jeannette Catsoulis,Rotten,2007-10-27,"Over the course of [its] sequels, the Saw franchise took a novel, if distasteful, idea and basically tortured it to death."

12681,m/stuff,Pablo Villaça,Rotten,2008-03-23,"At razoavelmente divertido em sua poca, tornou-se (ainda) pior com o passar do tempo, sobrevivendo apenas como mais um dos inmeros momentos embaraosos da cinematografia norte-americana dos anos 80."
12682,m/stuff,Nicholas Bell,Fresh,2020-10-08,"Though The Stuff isn't as effective as Cohen's more heralded titles (including the first installment of his It's Alive trilogy), it has all the hallmarks of his perverse sense of eco-terror."
12683,m/stuff,Aaron Hillis,Fresh,2003-09-10,"Playful comic-horror is a fine diversion. Consumers, beware!"
12684,m/stuff,Ken Hanke,Fresh,2003-08-24,Likably goofy Larry Cohen horror satire.

12687,m/stuff,Tom Long,Fresh,2019-02-04,"The Stuff probably won't make anybody's list of best films of the year, but it is an inspired, goofy, fast-moving piece of sci fi silliness, probably destined to become a cult favorite."
12688,m/sucker_punch_2011,Rob Power,Fresh,2011-12-22,"An ambitious yet flawed effort, but one executed with undoubted style and verve."
12689,m/sucker_punch_2011,Andrea Gronvall,Rotten,2011-12-06,"Gun-toting hotties combat assorted villains and their robot henchmen in this tawdry, repellent action fantasy."
12690,m/sucker_punch_2011,Johnny Gayzmonic,Rotten,2018-11-04,The film doesn't live up to the exciting spectacle of watching a steam-powered mech with a cute little kitty painted on the front mow down a giant zeppelin.
12691,m/sucker_punch_2011,Erin Free,Rotten,2011-04-05,"Unfortunately, however, the film mainly shows that if you give a filmmaker the world, he often won't have the necessary skills to navigate it."
12692,m/sucker_punch_2011,Andy Klein,Rotten,2011-03-28,Snyder's accomplishment is to drain that of any erotic heat; he generated a lot more with the glistening-with-sweat abs in 300 than he manages here.
12693,m/sucker_punch_2011,Lisa Giles-Keddie,Fresh,2011-04-01,"Sucker Punch is superficial and erotic visual stimulation, much like the kind of experience some might have when they immerse themselves in a video game to do battle with the enemy."
12694,m/sucker_punch_2011,Peter Sobczynski,Rotten,2011-03-26,"So bad that when the film's friendly lobotomist shows up to do his thing, I almost found myself standing up in my seat and shouting ""I'll have what she's having!"""
12695,m/sucker_punch_2011,Wilson Morales,Rotten,2011-03-25,"'Sucker Punch' is a film filled with emptiness and a hodgepodge of other films, it's like watching an unofficial sequel to 'Showgirls' with some 'Kill Bill' and 'Battle LA' thrown into the mix. Avoid at all costs."
12696,m/sucker_punch_2011,Brent McKnight,Rotten,2020-07-12,"Gross and skeevy, not to mention painfully long and repetitious."
12697,m/sucker_punch_2011,Jason Best,Fresh,2011-04-01,"Snyder's film is a warped mash-up of different genres - Gothic nightmare, psycho horror, steam-punk, Japanese manga, video game. File, though, under Guilty Pleasure."
12698,m/sucker_punch_2011,Jeff Beck,Rotten,2012-09-21,"While the visuals are quite impressive and go a long way towards helping the film, it's just not enough to recommend that you take the time to see ""Sucker Punch."""
12699,m/sucker_punch_2011,Sara Michelle Fetters,Rotten,2011-03-25,"All you need to know is that Sucker Punch is awful, probably on my shortlist of the worst motion pictures that I have ever seen. That's it, nothing more; as far as I'm concerned it's more then enough."
12700,m/sucker_punch_2011,Dan Jolin,Fresh,2011-03-28,"Ambitious and visually impressive as a pop-video mash-up, but, lacking a strong emotional core, it doesn't quite cohere as a fully satisfying movie."
12701,m/sucker_punch_2011,Brian Orndorf,Rotten,2011-03-24,"Snyder's made something authentically confused and moderately offensive, apparently eager to place this dodgy film at the feet of young girls in search of heroes -- his own glossy brand of marketable rebellion."
12702,m/sucker_punch_2011,Widgett Walls,Fresh,2011-03-28,Imagine the mind of a guy who has spent a good 20 years reading manga & watching anime & fantasy & sci-fi...and imagine that guy's id. That's pretty much what the film is.
12703,m/sucker_punch_2011,Jonathan W. Hickman,Rotten,2011-03-31,"A comic book cabaret that not even a 30 year old fanboy, living in his mother's basement, could love."
12704,m/sucker_punch_2011,Robert Roten,Rotten,2011-03-29,"Every character is a throwaway part in this story. Since there isn't any substantial attempt the lay the groundwork for emotional investment in any of these characters, it is a pretty empty film."
12705,m/sucker_punch_2011,Rob Humanick,Fresh,2011-05-04,Its multiple reality constructions are far more tingling than Inception's wannabe mind****.
12706,m/sucker_punch_2011,Micheal Compton,Rotten,2019-05-08,The worst kind of bad film -- a lazy one that never seems concerned about anything more than cashing in at the box office.

12716,m/suddenly_last_summer,Marjorie Baumgarten,Fresh,2003-03-10,"The battles between the imperious Hepburn and the presumed-mad Taylor are pure theatricality, while sensitive shrink Clift observes it all and emotes."
12717,m/suddenly_last_summer,Dwight MacDonald,Rotten,2019-07-12,"It is hard to know what to say about this misguided tour through the dank recesses of Mr. Williams' subconscious. It's all clearly nonsense, the rankest kind of Victorian melodrama."
12718,m/suddenly_last_summer,Dave Kehr,Rotten,2011-03-23,"The cast packs enough sexual ambiguity to satisfy the most rabid Williams fan (not to mention a screenplay by Gore Vidal), but Mankiewicz leaves much of the innuendo unexplored -- thankfully, perhaps."

12728,m/suffragette,Shawn Hazelett,Rotten,2015-10-26,Too often the film retreats from the complexity of its debates in favor of comprehension.
12729,m/suffragette,J. Olson,Fresh,2016-04-17,"The movie isn't as dynamic as it could have been, but it gets to the core of what big, important social change means - and how little glory there is in ground work."
12730,m/suffragette,Camilla Long,Rotten,2017-02-28,"What is the point of the silly, histrionic teatime drama Suffragette? Certainly not to focus on the actual suffering of the suffragettes, who a little more than 100 years ago were sent to prison and force-fed after a string of ""terrorist"" attacks."
12731,m/suffragette,Travis Hopson,Fresh,2015-10-30,This is a film so heavy on message that it forgets to tell the kind of rousing story it hopes to be.
12732,m/suffragette,Matthew Turner,Fresh,2015-10-09,This is a superbly acted and sharply written drama that manages to be powerfully emotional without resorting to manipulative sentimentality.
12733,m/suffragette,James Mottram,Fresh,2016-04-06,"Sarah Gavron's film is, amazingly, the first ever to be made about the Suffragettes."
12734,m/suffragette,Graham Fuller,Fresh,2015-10-29,Suffragette is exemplary in its attempt to depict the harrowing experiences of the British women who risked their lives to win the vote.
12735,m/suffragette,David Nusair,Rotten,2015-12-30,An astonishingly tedious drama...
12736,m/suffragette,Di Golding,Fresh,2018-12-10,"The backlash against Suffragette for white-washing history, and against the cast for being tone-deaf, is unfortunate but not unwarranted. The movie is good, but not good enough to rise above its own prejudices."
12737,m/suffragette,Eduardo Molina,Fresh,2016-01-18,"An interesting story, sadly we have too many loose ends at the end. [Full review in Spanish]"
12738,m/suffragette,Theresa Smith,Fresh,2016-03-02,"Surprisingly gentle, considering it is a film about the moment the suffragette movement in the UK turned militant, Suffragette is nevertheless stirring and moving."
12739,m/suffragette,Jay Stone,Fresh,2015-11-11,Suffragette is a worthwhile reminder of how far women have come and the price they had to pay to get here. We're left to imagine how much more there is to be done.
12740,m/suffragette,Donald Clarke,Fresh,2015-10-09,It is such a shame that Sarah Gavron's well-appointed film ends up in such bourgeois heritage territory.
12741,m/suffragette,Matthew Bond,Fresh,2017-10-26,The film does gain power as it moves along. Partly because the obvious injustice of women being denied the vote for so long becomes overwhelming and partly because of some very nice acting along the way.

12747,m/suffragette,Sasha Stone,Fresh,2015-09-15,"The supporting cast, including Helena Bonham Carter, Romola Garai and Anne-Marie Duff, are all top notch, and a reminder of how few films like this exist anywhere."
12748,m/summer_in_february,Wes Greene,Rotten,2014-01-14,"As sumptuous as it is immensely shallow, the film practically revels in its attention to lush English landscapes as a means to distract from its derivative storytelling."
12749,m/summer_in_february,Tara Brady,Rotten,2013-06-14,"We're supposed to be saddened that their world is ending and that the first World War, with its awful human toll, looms. Instead we're thinking where are the bloody Germans when you need them?"
12750,m/summer_in_february,Matthew Turner,Fresh,2013-06-13,"Engaging and enjoyable British period drama enlivened by a strong script, stunning locations, some impressive production design work and a trio of great performances from Emily Browning, Dan Stevens, and Dominic Cooper."
12751,m/summer_in_february,Kristy Puchko,Rotten,2014-01-17,"In the end, it's a miserable movie about miserable people, and we're left to wonder why. But any further time spent considering this forgettable romance feels wasted."
12752,m/summer_in_february,Betty Jo Tucker,Rotten,2014-01-20,"Gorgeous scenes along the Cornish coast are impressive, but the film lacks the dynamic chemistry between lovers that's so important in a romance-themed movie."

12758,m/summer_in_february,Andy Lea,Rotten,2013-06-13,"For the last half-hour, the director uses every trick in the book (rain machines, epic music, close-ups of sobbing girls) in a bid to jerk our tears. It was too much, too late. I was already looking at my watch."

12764,m/summer_in_february,Stephen Holden,Rotten,2014-01-16,"Compared with the tepid contretemps of ""Summer in February,"" the soap-opera theatrics of ""Downton Abbey"" have the depth of Chekhov."

12771,m/superfly_2018,Owen Gleiberman,Rotten,2018-06-12,"A competent yet glossy and hermetic street-hustle drug thriller, less a new urban myth than a lavishly concocted episode. It holds your attention yet leaves you with nothing."

12778,m/superfly_2018,Chris Nashawaty,Rotten,2018-06-13,The film's strip-club-and-slo-mo aesthetic is yanked right out of any number of hip-hop videos - and also about as deep.
12779,m/superfly_2018,Alci Rengifo,Rotten,2018-08-26,Superfly wants to bank off the title of a genre classic without keeping the spirit of the genre alive. It needs more verve than gloss and more brains than bullets.

13139,m/the_33,Wendy Ide,Fresh,2015-10-07,It's as though Riggen directs from a checklist of proven emotive shots. However there is no question that this is an extraordinary tale of human fortitude and resilience ...

13201,m/the_babadook,Brigid Presecky,Fresh,2019-08-14,"The Babadook is impressive for its focused script, acting as a giant metaphor about either letting our demons take over of our lives or learning to keep them at bay, no matter how scary it may seem."

13205,m/the_babadook,Steven Rea,Fresh,2014-12-05,No matter how successful The Babadook turns out to be - and Jennifer Kent's horror story deserves all the success it gets - the prospects of a best-selling kid-lit tie-in don't look good.
13206,m/the_babadook,Matt Prigge,Fresh,2014-11-24,"It's almost a shame it turns into a ghost movie at all, but not quite."
13207,m/the_babadook,Lisa Rosman,Fresh,2016-10-05,"For all its otherworldly flourishes, it confirms that the most terrifying monsters are remarkably local -- domestic, even."

13214,m/the_ballad_of_buster_scruggs,Joe Friar,Fresh,2018-11-17,"Tragedy is at the forefront of the Coen Brothers western anthology. The wildly entertaining yarn incorporates many of the Coen's staples, quirky characters, witty dialogue, and plenty of misfortune."
13215,m/the_ballad_of_buster_scruggs,Stephen Silver,Fresh,2018-11-30,"The opening segment might be the best 15 minutes of any film this year. Unfortunately, the film never reaches that level again."

13219,m/the_ballad_of_buster_scruggs,Brian Orndorf,Fresh,2018-11-08,"Consistency isn't always there, but ""Scruggs"" is pure Joel and Ethan Coen, and that always offers something fascinating, even when they get lost in their own creation."
13220,m/the_ballad_of_buster_scruggs,Todd McCarthy,Fresh,2018-08-31,"Despite the snark and irreverence, genre specialists will eat up the devotion to detail here, from the relish the Coens take in writing colorful 19th century Western vernacular to the musical choices and the lovely between-acts artwork."
13221,m/the_ballad_of_buster_scruggs,Adam Sweeting,Fresh,2018-10-17,"Even the spottier moments are enlivened by the Coens' knack for myth-spinning, ably assisted by Carter Burwell's eclectic, evocative score."
13222,m/the_ballad_of_buster_scruggs,Lauren Humphries-Brooks,Fresh,2018-10-30,"There is undoubted power and entertainment in these stories, a harkening back to the quintessential American genre that manages to also play with and undercut its own myth-making power."
13223,m/the_ballad_of_buster_scruggs,Ella Kemp,Fresh,2018-10-14,"It offers as much satisfaction as an unstable advent calendar. There's definitely something sweet behind every door, but it rarely tastes as fun as it looks."
13224,m/the_ballad_of_buster_scruggs,Tim Appelo,Fresh,2018-11-19,"Any full-length Coen brothers' movie beats these six shorts, but they're all gorgeous, original and often funny."
13225,m/the_ballad_of_buster_scruggs,Josh Bell,Fresh,2018-11-08,"Ballad may not be a TV series, but if the Coens wanted to open that fake book back up and spin some more yarns, more episodes would be welcome."
13226,m/the_ballad_of_buster_scruggs,Jake Pesaruk,Fresh,2018-11-15,"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is a formidable first outing for the Coens on a streaming format, but there is no doubt that this narrative six-shooter has a couple of duds."
13227,m/the_ballad_of_buster_scruggs,J.R. Kinnard,Fresh,2018-12-01,"The storytelling is so delicate and precise, like a beautiful poem squeezed of every superfluous word. This is some of the Coen Brothers best work and it deserves to be seen."

13238,m/the_banshee_chapter,A.A. Dowd,Rotten,2014-01-09,"The Banshee Chapter can't seem to decide if it wants to be a found-footage horror movie, or a more traditional one. To its detriment, it splits the difference."

13243,m/the_banshee_chapter,Anton Bitel,Fresh,2013-08-27,"It works as a gonzo expos of some of the 20th century's madder moments - but perhaps more importantly, this psychotropic remapping of history never forgets to be proper jump-out-of-your-seat scary. Think of it as Fear and Loathing in Chamber 5..."
13244,m/the_banshee_chapter,Jennie Kermode,Fresh,2014-01-10,"Although no single strand within it can be called original, Banshee Chapter blends them flawlessly, delivering the most convincing piece of otherworldly horror for years."
13245,m/the_banshee_chapter,Maitland McDonagh,Fresh,2014-01-09,"Ultimately, Banshee Chapter isn't a game-changer, but it's a tight, neatly constructed little shocker that delivers what it promises -- would that many bigger films could say the same."
13246,m/the_banshee_chapter,Wes Greene,Fresh,2014-01-07,"Director Blair Erickson surely has style to burn, even if he oftentimes betrays his atmospheric shorthand and gets cold feet at the most inopportune moments."
13247,m/the_banshee_chapter,Brian Orndorf,Fresh,2014-01-09,"Although it doesn't push the limits of horror as far as it could, the feature offers a mildly unnerving journey into the abyss of the brain, dialing up the creep-out factor as it investigates a nightmare rooted in reality."

13249,m/the_banshee_chapter,Sean Hogan,Rotten,2014-01-28,The film avoids any real attempt at constructing scarily effective set-pieces in favour of having one of the unnamed entities pop screeching out of the dark whack-a-mole-style every few minutes.

13261,m/the_beast_with_five_fingers,John Beifuss,Fresh,2014-01-06,"As it torments Lorre, the hand becomes a manifestation of the metaphorical notion of a hand tugging us toward our destiny or reaching from the past to punish us; an alternate, utterly appropriate title might be 'The Hand of Fate.'"

13266,m/the_big_year,Mary F. Pols,Fresh,2011-10-13,"It's like an Easter egg hunt for adults, joyous and sweet. The Big Year competition may be fierce, but the movie is as soft as a bunny."
13267,m/the_big_year,Chris Hewitt,Rotten,2011-10-13,"Steve Martin, Jack Black and Owen Wilson all have made a great film or two, surrounded by tons of bad ones. ""The Big Year"" is closer to the latter."
13268,m/the_big_year,Kimberly Gadette,Rotten,2011-10-14,A game of Angry Birds is far more enjoyable than this flocked-up mess. A script written in wingdings would have been preferable.
13269,m/the_big_year,Jeff Meyers,Rotten,2011-10-16,"If The Big Year does anything, it highlights how far Martin, Black, and Wilson have fallen from the giddy, off-kilter humor they used to bring to projects."
13270,m/the_big_year,Liam Lacey,Rotten,2011-10-21,"The result is an offence-free, mild entertainment in which everyone from cast to scriptwriter seems to be winging it."

13282,m/the_big_year,James Plath,Rotten,2012-02-05,"If you go into it not expecting big comedy, ""The Big Year"" can be an enjoyable diversion for an evening. But it helps if you like nature."
13283,m/the_big_year,Alison Gang,Rotten,2011-10-14,"""The Big Year"" proves yet again that comedy isn't just magic that happens when funny people stand next to each other. They actually have to be doing or saying, or not doing or not saying, something that might inspire humor."

13288,m/the_black_cat_1981,Christopher Machell,Fresh,2017-01-17,A meandering plot and unintentional humour are far from enough to detract from this beautifully shot and atmospheric voyage into the dark.
13289,m/the_black_cat_1981,Jordan M. Smith,Rotten,2020-10-20,"Lucio Fulci's mid-period The Black Cat just pilfer's Poe's original for exploitational imagery, essentially ditching the self sabotaging inner turmoil for a superfluous supernatural yarn stuffed with non sequiturs."
13290,m/the_boxer,Geoff Andrew,Fresh,2006-02-09,"While Sheridan (who co-wrote) weighs in with gutsy, gritty direction, shooting the fight scenes with panache and cutting sharply throughout for suspense and pace. Politically, too, it's sensitive and sensible."
13291,m/the_boxer,Carrie Rickey,Fresh,2013-05-14,"Day-Lewis has the ability to make the will to nonviolence look positively volcanic. And Watson, with her 200-watt incandescence, makes longing look radiant."
13292,m/the_boxer,Todd McCarthy,Fresh,2008-07-07,"The third collaboration between director Jim Sheridan and actor Daniel Day-Lewis, The Boxer is an involving but rather prosaic report from the Belfast front with a melancholy undertow of romantic yearning."
13293,m/the_boxer,Stephen Hunter,Fresh,2013-05-14,Sheridan is very good on the ways and means of the IRA.
13294,m/the_boxer,Laura Clifford,Fresh,2013-05-14,Brian Cox is strong as the tough old IRA chief who realizes that change is essential. The choices his character makes are surprising. Cox resembles a more muted Albert Finney in this role.
13295,m/the_boxer,Robert Roten,Rotten,2001-01-01,"The characters were sullen and taciturn. When they did speak, they didn't reveal anything useful."
13296,m/the_boxer,Roger Hurlburt,Rotten,2013-05-14,"In this dull film, poignant characters caught up in histrionics flail with one glove, while much emotional shadowboxing is done with the other."
13297,m/the_boxer,Margaret A. McGurk,Fresh,2002-10-15,"Day-Lewis is superb. His boxing scenes are every bit as credible as his love scenes, and his performance throughout hums with intensity wrung from stillness and restraint. Ms. Watson proves equal to her co-star."
13298,m/the_boxer,Liam Lacey,Rotten,2002-04-12,"There is little chance for the movie's talented stars, Day Lewis and Emily Watson to establish and develop their characters, beyond their set-piece declarations of love."
13299,m/the_boxer,Nick Davis,Rotten,2003-01-10,"The gravity of this environment, though, unfortunately highlights the insipidity and artificiality of Sheridan and George's screenplay."

13301,m/the_boxer,Jay Boyar,Fresh,2013-05-14,"If The Boxer doesn't quite score a knockout, that's because of such flaws as the too-sketchy development of the character of Maggie's son, who turns out to be pivotal. But the movie carries the day by aiming its strongest punches straight at the heart."
13302,m/the_boxer,Ted Prigge,Fresh,2000-01-01,"The acting is amazing, with Day-Lewis and Watson giving excellent performances and showing great chemistry."
13303,m/the_boxer,Rob Blackwelder,Fresh,2000-01-01,The Boxer would be only a strongly-directed special interest film if it wasn't for the emotional intensity provided by Day-Lewis and Watson.
13304,m/the_boxer,Edward Guthmann,Fresh,2000-01-01,"Daniel Day-Lewis is such a consummate actor that every film he makes, and every blood- and-sinew performance he delivers, tends to have the stamp of prestige about it."
13305,m/the_boxer,Matt Soergel,Rotten,2013-05-14,"We never figure out, though, what drives Day-Lewis' Danny. We just take it on faith that he's stubborn and sick of violence. The filmmakers don't help much, offering just a twist on the star-crossed lovers story, mixed with standard boxing melodrama."
13306,m/the_boxer,Madeleine Williams,Fresh,2000-01-01,"Director Jim Sheridan teams up again with Daniel Day-Lewis for another Irish saga. But this one, while enjoyable, doesn't quite live up to their prior films."

13316,m/the_boy,Jackie K. Cooper,Rotten,2016-01-23,Not as bad as the trailer makes it look & for a horror film it has a substantial plot.
13317,m/the_boy,Ken McIntyre,Rotten,2016-12-28,"Some decent jump scares here and there, but the best part of the whole ordeal is watching Cohan keep an admirably straight face through this nonsense."
13318,m/the_boy,Michael Nordine,Rotten,2016-01-25,"There's only so much she can do once the movie around her devolves into the usual barrage of jump scares, but Cohan maintains her composure even as Greta loses hers."
13319,m/the_boy,Eddie Harrison,Rotten,2016-03-14,"A heavy reliance on dream sequences for jump scares reveals that the storyline has nowhere to go, and the climactic twists are underwhelming."
13320,m/the_boy,Marija Djurovic,Rotten,2016-03-31,"The Boy is not as scary as you its premise promises and, although relatively high on the creep-front, it doesn't fully realise its ambitious ideas and get to the end without stumbling over."

13322,m/the_boy,Jim Lane,Rotten,2016-02-05,"The movie violates its own internal logic and dissolves into worn-out slasher-flick tropes. Too bad; Menear and Bell had a bizarrely good thing going, but they couldn't come up with an ending."
13323,m/the_boy,Frank Ochieng,Rotten,2018-11-09,The Boy certainly has its moments of shock value but the sluggish story feels lukewarm for the most part. It is such a shame that The Boy could not capitalize any further on its strange and hypnotic inclinations.
13324,m/the_boy,Steve Newton,Rotten,2016-01-22,"As creepy-doll flicks go, The Boy isn't the worst I've ever seen. That honour would probably go to 2007's Dead Silence."

13842,m/the_knot_2012,Rich Cline,Rotten,2012-10-08,"Clearly intent on being a British Hangover/Bridesmaids hybrid, this comedy romp doesn't contain a single laugh. It doesn't help that all of the characters are deeply unlikeable, or that the humour is literally centred in the toilet."
13843,m/the_knot_2012,Guy Lodge,Rotten,2012-10-13,The Knot finds a bumbling groomsman fishing for silver wedding bands in a diarrhea-filled toilet bowl. Viewers searching for moments of wit or insight ... might relate.

13849,m/the_last_full_measure,Kim Hughes,Fresh,2020-01-23,The Last Full Measure stands as a fascinating document of the awfulness of war and as a touching (if occasionally syrupy) rumination on the nature and provenance of valor.
13850,m/the_last_full_measure,Richard Whittaker,Rotten,2020-01-24,"At this point, having every Vietnamese character be a bloodthirsty butcher with no lines reinforces that this feels more like a 1980s TV movie than a considered tribute to a fallen hero"

13873,m/the_little_mermaid_1989,William Thomas,Fresh,2000-01-01,"This was the rebirth of Disney in the modern era and due to superb songs, enduring humour and a touching plot it remains an animation classic."
13874,m/the_little_mermaid_1989,Desmond Ryan,Fresh,2013-11-15,"The latest Disney offering looks back to the studio's unrivaled heritage. It has the look of classic animation. More important, it has the skill required to make it work."

13886,m/the_lodgers,Sarah Cartland,Fresh,2018-11-12,"Horror motifs pile up in this stylishly directed, supernatural tale. It's a cold burn of a film though, and I felt dispassionate about the fate of the isolated teenage twins."
13887,m/the_lodgers,Austin Trunick,Rotten,2018-03-03,"The Lodgers' ominous tone is handled masterfully, and the house itself is incredibly spooky, but the story takes far too long to tell what little there is to it. It's a shame."
13888,m/the_lodgers,Dennis Harvey,Fresh,2017-09-16,"As a ripe chunk of pure baroque atmosphere, this lushly staged costume chiller is a fragrant beauty indeed."
13889,m/the_lodgers,Norman Gidney,Rotten,2018-02-28,"The Lodgers, for all of its splendor, can't seem to rise above surface references to far more effective pieces like The Others or The Orphanage. We really do get a visual and aural feast. But it wasn't original enough to make me forget what influenced it."
13890,m/the_lodgers,Harry Guerin,Fresh,2018-03-07,The Lodgers looks superb with Co Wexford's Loftus Hall - 'the most haunted house in Ireland' - more than ready for its close-up. If you take your coat off chances are you'll be putting it on again as the temperature drops.
13891,m/the_lodgers,Adam Nayman,Rotten,2017-09-28,"Things creak in The Lodgers, a painfully genteel Irish horror movie haunted by the spirits of superior ghost stories."

13898,m/the_lodgers,Jared Mobarak,Rotten,2017-09-12,The Lodgers reveals itself to be a beautiful gothic horror with a captivating truth mishandled in a desire to surprise more than resonate.
13899,m/the_lodgers,Kristy Strouse,Rotten,2018-03-02,"It seems that The Lodgers never quite meets its potential. This is the kind of film that has been done before, better, but that I believe keeps us optimistic for the future of those involved."
13900,m/the_lodgers,Matt Donato,Rotten,2019-11-06,A case of less not being more; the audience lulled into a state of indifference that O'Malley's suspended underwater climax cannot revive.
13901,m/the_lodgers,Loretta Goff,Fresh,2018-03-21,"Overall, while the film's narrative does let it down in some places, feeling a bit simplified, this is made up for by its stunning visual style, gothic-drenched atmosphere and strong acting by the two leads."
13902,m/the_lodgers,Chris Knight,Fresh,2018-02-23,"The lugubrious tone, studded with murky references to Edgar Allen Poe and shaded with forbidden sexual longing, may strike some as a little tiresome. But the set design is amazing."
13903,m/the_lodgers,Noel Murray,Fresh,2018-02-22,"For viewers who take it more as a moody, metaphorical historical drama than as an out-and-out horror film, there's a lot in this lush-looking, sensitively acted picture to recommend."

13909,m/the_loft,Mark H. Harris,Rotten,2015-02-05,"Despite a strong, recognizable cast, The Loft comes off a sterile, second-rate thriller more suited for the direct-to-video route."
13910,m/the_loft,Mark Dujsik,Rotten,2015-01-30,The Loft is a prime example of a movie that does not trust the rather elegant simplicity of its premise.

13915,m/the_loft,Dustin Putman,Rotten,2015-01-29,"Dissipating with every turn of the screw and ending in an undeservedly too-nice, too-neat denouement, ""The Loft"" is akin to a hollow shellattractive on the outside, and empty where it counts."
13916,m/the_loft,Amanda Greever,Rotten,2019-02-01,"Unfortunately, its ridiculousness and the in-your-face sleaze factor doesn't leave the viewer feeling anything."

13918,m/the_loft,Ken Hanke,Rotten,2015-02-03,"The most startling thing about it is that anyone thought this story needed telling a third time -- and not just one anyone, but a group of them had to come to this crackpot conclusion."
13919,m/the_loft,Debbie Baldwin,Rotten,2018-11-01,This plot has more holes than a slice of baby Swiss.
13920,m/the_loft,Katie Rife,Rotten,2015-02-05,"The Loft is a film that can't decide what it wants. It's a male fantasy, and a cautionary tale. It's sleazy in concept, and timid in execution. It punishes its protagonists for their transgressions, then lets them off the hook."
13921,m/the_loft,Simon Abrams,Rotten,2015-02-02,"The Loft's boorish leads aren't sensible enough to be worth caring about, making the film's character-driven conclusion feel like a self-defeating cop-out."
13922,m/the_loft,Teddy Durgin,Rotten,2015-01-30,"The amount of double-crosses, betrayals, red herrings, possible suspects, possible motives, twists, and turns becomes quite ludicrous. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)"

14469,m/the_wedding_ringer,Micheal Compton,Rotten,2019-01-24,"Hart's manic comic style is actually a good mix with Gad's uptight Doug, but the chemistry never quite clicks largely because Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender's script constantly aims for the lowest denominator possible."
14470,m/the_wedding_ringer,Andy Crump,Rotten,2015-01-23,"For a moment, the film gives the impression of well-intentioned shagginess. But as The Wedding Ringer progresses full steam ahead, the only daring it shows is in its willingness to offend with ignorance."

14486,m/the_whole_truth_2016,Steve Greene,Rotten,2017-01-01,"The film's closing minutes offer some parting pieces of information that upend some previously laid assumptions, but it's a grafted-on coda rather than a well-choreographed gut punch."

14499,m/the_whole_truth_2016,Nicholas Bell,Rotten,2019-10-03,The only real anomalistic quality to Courtney Hunt's long awaited sophomore feature The Whole Truth is why she chose to undertake this derivatively formulated courtroom drama in the first place.
14500,m/the_whole_truth_2016,Noel Murray,Rotten,2016-10-20,"Usually, with a movie as mundane as The Whole Truth, it's tempting to say that a better cast and crew would've made something more special. But on paper, this film had the goods."
14501,m/the_whole_truth_2016,Conor O'Donnell,Fresh,2016-10-21,"There's nothing monumental at play in The Whole Truth, but it's not entirely without merit, satisfying on the same level one would digest a grocery store paperback."

14514,m/the_wild_life,Soren Andersen,Rotten,2016-09-08,"All things considered, this pitifully plotted Belgian-French production represents the nadir of animated movies released so far this year, a farrago of frantic action and mindless cacophony."

14535,m/the_wind_rises,Chris Knight,Fresh,2014-02-20,The result is a timelessness and warmth that computer graphics have learned to mimic; the difference being that Miyazaki has never strayed from the traditional in the first place.

14726,m/to_have_and_have_not,Tim Dirks,Fresh,2000-01-01,To Have and Have Not (1944) was director Howard Hawks' wartime adventure masterpiece - a minor film classic loosely based upon part of Ernest Hemingway's 1937 novel of the same name. Jules Furthman and William Faulkner partnered their talents
14727,m/to_have_and_have_not,Matt Brunson,Fresh,2018-12-21,"The dialogue crackles (including the legendary ""whistle / blow"" line), Bacall sizzles, and Bogart captivates."

14738,m/to_rome_with_love,Emanuel Levy,Rotten,2012-06-16,"Frivolous, schematic, and overlong, Allen's valentine to the Eternal City is one of the weakest entries in his European film tour."

14740,m/to_rome_with_love,Derek Malcolm,Rotten,2012-09-14,This stale and flaccid exercise looks as if it has come from one of those old notebooks in which [Allen] keeps discarded ideas.
14741,m/to_rome_with_love,Joseph Walsh,Rotten,2018-08-23,Even Allen's most loyal of fans must be starting to wonder why the once great director keeps on producing such dull material.
14742,m/to_rome_with_love,Stephen Whitty,Rotten,2012-06-22,"Even loyal fans have to admit this isn't so much a movie as four little one-page New Yorker stories, strung together with ""Volare"" and one-too-many shots of the Trevi fountain."

14752,m/to_rome_with_love,Rob Thomas,Fresh,2012-09-12,"Honestly, ""Rome"" is a clear step down from ""Midnight."" But it's a fun, breezy film audiences will enjoy while it lasts and forget soon after. Heaven knows he's made worse films."

14760,m/tomboy_2011,David Edwards,Fresh,2011-09-16,"Although only a small film and one that barely runs to feature length, it raises some unique and thought-provoking ideas."
14761,m/tomboy_2011,Marjorie Baumgarten,Fresh,2011-12-09,Tomboy captures a delicate moment in time before issues of sexuality so much more complicated and calculated.
14762,m/tomboy_2011,Brent Simon,Fresh,2011-11-30,"Against a backdrop of overly programmed 'issue dramas,' this superb movie is notable for its strong foundation in character and wholesale investment in psychological motivation, rather than salacious plotting."

14765,m/tomboy_2011,Robert Abele,Fresh,2011-11-24,"Quiet and naturalistic in the best way, the French film ""Tomboy"" rolls out a tale of malleable pre-adolescent identity with a marked absence of sensationalism."
14766,m/tomboy_2011,Scott Tobias,Fresh,2011-11-17,"There's an absolute naturalism to all the performances here. That's crucial, especially from Heran, who's playing a character who does not yet know herself."
14767,m/tomboy_2011,Andrew L. Urban,Fresh,2012-03-24,"Sweet and well observed, the film takes us inside a typical family in a typical Paris suburb - and gives us a spin"
14768,m/tomboy_2011,Cynthia Fuchs,Fresh,2011-12-07,"As the sisters come to see that dresses and haircuts and behaviors are a means to create a self, to communicate with others, Tomboy doesn't offer an easy answer; instead, it lets you wonder why gender must be so definitive."
14769,m/tomboy_2011,Jennie Punter,Fresh,2011-12-02,"Tomboy reveals a side of pre-adolescence rarely (if ever) depicted on the big screen, yet it never feels like a curiosity piece, nor is Laure (Zo Hran), the titular character, portrayed as an outsider from a troubled home."
14770,m/tomboy_2011,Nora Lee Mandel,Fresh,2011-11-17,Each day is a suspenseful challenge of how [the kid] keeps up a freeing masquerade; it's striking to see how gender casually figures into the daily life of children at play.

14795,m/topp-twins-untouchable-girls,Doris Toumarkine,Fresh,2011-05-13,Terrifically entertaining documentary about New Zealand's lesbian Topp Twins and their extraordinary career is a heart-warming eye-opener that provides insights into so much more than the sexual orientation of its two remarkable subjects.
14796,m/towelhead,Jim Schembri,Fresh,2008-10-10,"[Ball] succeeds admirably and with dramatic force, blending themes of racism, liberalism, emotional betrayal, abuse, hate speech and pedophilia into a confronting adult drama peppered with shocks and black humour."
14797,m/towelhead,KJ Doughton,Fresh,2008-06-24,"Boasting ten-dimensional characters and the sophisticated juggling of difficult themes, Ball's powerful, complex movie is a must-see."
14798,m/towelhead,Owen Gleiberman,Fresh,2008-09-10,"As it becomes clear that Ball, in essence, has just restaged American Beauty with a socially conscious paint job, the sensationalism of Towelhead looks more and more like a dramatic tic."
14799,m/towelhead,Robert Davis,Rotten,2008-09-11,"Screenwriter Alan Ball is no stranger to daring stories, but in his awkward film directorial debut he seems unable to capture the soul of Alicia Erian's novel — and with a story like this, that's disastrous."

14807,m/towelhead,Bill Goodykoontz,Rotten,2008-09-25,"It's too much, too heavy-handed. Disturbing is one thing. Prurient is another."
14808,m/towelhead,Rene Rodriguez,Fresh,2008-09-26,It's Ball's complex and frank approach to subject matter normally depicted in black-and-white terms that distinguishes Towelhead from so many coming-of-age dramas before it.

14811,m/towelhead,David Edelstein,Rotten,2008-09-08,"The film is superbly acted, but it's hard to know what to feel except, 'How can any girl navigate this oversexualized culture?'"
14812,m/towelhead,Ty Burr,Rotten,2008-09-19,"[Director] Ball's trying to be honest about adolescent coming of age, but since he's dishonest about everything else, the movie collapses in on itself, ending with a laughably pat resolution that renders Towelhead a Bizarro World After School Special."
14813,m/towelhead,Sean Axmaker,Rotten,2008-09-18,"How is it that Alan Ball wrote some of the most nuanced, layered, dynamic characters on TV in"
14814,m/towelhead,Pete Hammond,Rotten,2008-10-01,Ball falls prey to his own inadequacies and makes a movie audiences are going to feel awfully uncomfortable watching.

14826,m/transformers_revenge_of_the_fallen,Bob Bloom,Rotten,2009-06-24,"The movie is formulaic and routine, which suits (Michael) Bay's directorial style. Creativity is anathema to this by-the-numbers cinematic traffic cop."
14827,m/transformers_revenge_of_the_fallen,Rebecca Murray,Rotten,2009-06-23,"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is what it is: a big-budget spectacle with an incredible amount of action, a frivolous plot, and one hot chick."
14828,m/transformers_revenge_of_the_fallen,Brandon Judell,Rotten,2009-07-01,"If when you were a child--either with Mr. Wizard or alone--you had passed a magnet over a pile of iron filings, you would have unknowingly created the action scenes of Michael Bay's latest blockbuster, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen."
14829,m/transformers_revenge_of_the_fallen,Stephanie Zacharek,Rotten,2009-06-24,Bay seems to think that just showing us a bunch of brightly clashing metallic limbs (accompanied by lots of noise) is enough to make us faint in our seats with excitement.
14830,m/transformers_revenge_of_the_fallen,Mike Edwards,Rotten,2011-03-01,"Bayformers 2 is a mess of a story loosely glued together with lame jokes, fighting pixels and Megan Fox's ass."
14831,m/transformers_revenge_of_the_fallen,Kevin A. Ranson,Rotten,2009-06-27,... there's no time to digest anything going on or in anyway connect with it because (Michael) Bay just HAS to show you something else... right now.
14832,m/transformers_revenge_of_the_fallen,Lou Lumenick,Rotten,2009-06-23,"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen dazzles the eye, numbs the mind and may cause deafness in some cases."

14837,m/transformers_revenge_of_the_fallen,Jeff Vice,Rotten,2009-06-23,"The dubious, tasteless humor and awful dialogue don't help. Neither does having a leading lady who can't act -- Fox seems to be regressing in her development as a performer."

14856,m/treasure_planet,Erik Childress,Rotten,2002-11-27,"Visually rather stunning, but ultimately a handsome-looking bore, the true creativity would have been to hide Treasure Planet entirely and completely reimagine it."
14857,m/treasure_planet,Andy Klein,Rotten,2002-11-27,"'Treasure Plane' starts with the clever idea of transforming the story into an old-fashioned space opera, and the animated visuals are handily up to the studio's best.

14902,m/truman_show,Roger Ebert,Fresh,2000-01-01,"The underlying ideas made the movie more than just entertainment. Like Gattaca, the previous film written by Niccol, it brings into focus the new values that technology is forcing on humanity."

14904,m/truman_show,Rory L. Aronsky,Fresh,2005-08-28,"With the reality TV boom, it brings forth more thoughts as to whether our society could ever be this extreme, and with each viewing, its themes deepen."
14905,m/truman_show,David Edelstein,Fresh,2013-06-19,"The movie might have been a soulless exercise without [Carrey]. With him, it has an authentic tremulousness, and also a dread, as if Pinocchio needed to take on Gepetto and Jiminy Crickett to become a real boy."

14920,m/trust_2010,Tim Robey,Fresh,2011-07-07,"Schwimmer, for all his film's limitations, deserves a lot of credit for finding a gifted actress the same age as his central character, and sculpting Liberato's blazing, wounded, needy and all-round award-level performance into the gem it is."
14921,m/trust_2010,Peter Bradshaw,Rotten,2011-07-07,The whole section of the plot dealing with Will's shame and rage at failing to protect his child is hammily and unconvincingly acted.

14927,m/trust_2010,Brent Simon,Fresh,2011-04-14,"Trust is heartrending in its depiction of the gulf between the female teenage victim of such a coercive assault and especially her father, as well as the manner in which adolescent judgment is reasonably fallible."
14928,m/trust_2010,Kyle Smith,Rotten,2011-04-01,"The script is blaring and obvious at all times, and in his second directorial effort, David Schwimmer doesn't have a clue how dull it is for the audience to endure scene after scene of anguish, crying and screaming matches."

14936,m/turning-green,S. James Snyder,Rotten,2009-11-11,"Both Project Greenlight runners-up, directors Michael Aimette and John G. Hofmann get the teen angst and Gaelic aesthetic right; too bad their third-act thuggery isn't just routine, but ridiculous."

14946,m/two_evil_eyes,Richard Harrington,Fresh,2000-01-01,"But where Romero goes for the cheap, linear approach, Argento's storytelling is painfully poetic, with ever-shifting points of view and asides... There's a madness in Argento's method and it's always appropriate."

14954,m/two_evil_eyes,Mike Bracken,Rotten,2018-10-08,"Two Evil Eyes is a flawed project. Romero's segment doesn't pull its own weight. While it is creepy in spots, the majority of the story is overlong and ho-hum in the execution."
14955,m/two_evil_eyes,Kevin Thomas,Fresh,2018-10-08,"It is amazing what Argento has been able to do in his 65-minute ""The Black Cat,"" which is the more ingenious--and gory--of the two parts."
14956,m/two_evil_eyes,Jenny Sanders,Fresh,2018-10-08,"Playing out like a mediocre episode of Tales From The Crypt, it's slow, largely uneventful and not particularly exciting when something does happen...

15312,m/wall_street_money_never_sleeps,Diva Velez,Fresh,2010-09-25,Good thing for Stone that Michael Douglas slips so easily into his hair gel and Armani suit as Gordon Gekko and manages to make this warmed-over soap opera bearably entertaining.
15313,m/wall_street_money_never_sleeps,Stephanie Zacharek,Rotten,2010-09-23,"There's lots of talk and very little true wisdom which, come to think of it, is also a defining characteristic of the overinflated bubble world the movie is so desperately trying to puncture."

15491,m/whiplash_2014,Sean O'Connell,Fresh,2014-10-09,A spellbinding make-or-break movie aimed at those who have ever wanted to be good at something. At anything. It's one of the year's best films.
15492,m/whiplash_2014,Jeffrey M. Anderson,Fresh,2014-10-18,"Frankly, I would urge viewers to see this film, if for no other reason, than for the final scene. It's the kind of scene that involuntarily quickens your heart, makes your jaw fall open, and catches your breath."
15493,m/whiplash_2014,CJ Johnson,Fresh,2014-10-23,"An extremely confident, stylish, brash and superbly crafted melodrama that manages, in its contained story, to examine ambition, elitism, bullying, musicianship, scholarship and many other underlying themes. It is taut, rigorous and menacing."
15494,m/whiplash_2014,Sean Axmaker,Fresh,2015-03-14,"This is as much psychological thriller as musical drama and it turns on the increasingly toxic chemistry between two clearly damaged people, to the exclusion of pretty much anyone else in the film."
15495,m/whirlpool,Geoff Andrew,Fresh,2007-10-23,"It's a fine example of the way Preminger, on occasion, managed to deflect routine melodrama into something more personal and profound."
15496,m/whirlpool,Bosley Crowther,Rotten,2007-10-23,There is no doubt that people will do strange things under hypnotic spell and that the techniques of hypnotism may be villainously employed. But you don't catch this fairly rational corner believing for one minute the hocuspocus that goes on.
15497,m/whirlpool,Jonathan Rosenbaum,Fresh,2007-10-23,Preminger's ambiguous relation to his characters and his sense of moral relativity have seldom been put to such haunting use.

15502,m/whirlpool,Christopher Machell,Fresh,2017-01-17,"Whirlpool's stand-out scene, in which a somnambulant Gene Tierney incriminates herself ... uses the conventions of horror cinema as much as that of noir."
15503,m/whirlpool,Josephine O'Neill,Fresh,2019-03-25,Jose Ferrer's insolent finesse turns a conventional melodrama into a fascinating; one-man show.

15518,m/white_god,Marc Mohan,Fresh,2015-04-17,"As a dark, Eastern European take on ""Benji the Hunted,"" ""White God"" holds some fascination. But as an indictment of the evil that men do, it's all bark and no bite."
15519,m/white_god,Robert Abele,Fresh,2015-04-02,"By turns Dickensian, Marxist and dystopian, it's a movie as deliriously unclassifiable as it is expertly focused in its desire to provoke and entertain."

15522,m/white_god,C.J. Prince,Fresh,2019-06-06,"White God's attempts to merge arthouse sensibilities with B-movie fun tends to be hit or miss, but while Mundruczo may falter on the arthouse side, he certainly knows how to make an entertaining genre film."

15626,m/wilson_2017,Sarah Ward,Rotten,2017-05-31,"Wilson, the man, may serve up great work from Harrelson, but Wilson, the movie, soon proves that 94 minutes in the character's company are far too many."

15641,m/win_it_all,Britt Hayes,Fresh,2017-03-28,"Win It All is a largely enjoyable exercise in the concept of acting as reacting, as most of the film's plot (and humor) is driven by the ways people respond to Eddie and his predicament."
15642,m/win_it_all,Michael Roffman,Fresh,2017-03-12,"It's a dense character study that rests on the shoulders of Jake Johnson, who delivers his strongest performance to date, casually handling every scene with a magnetism that recalls the likes of '70s era De Niro and Caan."

15745,m/x_men_apocalypse,Matthew Pejkovic,Rotten,2016-09-29,Singer once brought an intimacy to the social political dimensions that often made the X-Men franchise the thinking man's superhero movie. Yet it is clear that the weight in the themes that come with ...Apocalypse has left Singer and his movie floundering.
15746,m/x_men_apocalypse,Glenn Kenny,Rotten,2016-05-26,"For every lively moment, there's a reminder that the franchise is tiring. The genre's emphasis on potential mass death is obsessive and unimaginative."
15747,m/x_men_apocalypse,Tom Bond,Rotten,2019-04-03,Apocalypse is so desperate to get your attention it forgets to earn it.
15748,m/x_men_apocalypse,Diva Velez,Rotten,2016-05-17,"Its ham-fisted, overemotional script, completely bereft of charm or ingenuity, its unremarkable villain and second-rate special effects make X-Men: Apocalypse the least successful of the recent Marvel entries."
15749,m/x_men_apocalypse,Brian Lowry,Fresh,2016-05-26,"Those who have seen the previous ""X-Men"" movies will likely feel motivated to keep their run complete, and over 2 hours and 23 minutes, they mostly get their money's worth."
15750,m/x_men_apocalypse,Brian Orndorf,Fresh,2016-05-12,"Singer continues to bring things back to where he left them in ""X2: X-Men United"" while still fiddling around with the particulars, hungry to make the mutant world colossal once again."
15751,m/x_men_apocalypse,Annalee Newitz,Rotten,2018-05-22,"Fiery, intense moments are undermined by a predictable plot."
15752,m/x_men_apocalypse,Paul Whitington,Fresh,2016-05-20,"Bryan Singer has made enough of these superhero things to know how to put them together, and for long periods balances competing story lines and the contradictory needs of action and drama reasonably well."
15753,m/x_men_apocalypse,Alistair Ryder,Fresh,2018-11-07,"Despite appearing emotionally and thematically hollow compared to the overwrought subtexts of previous entries, Apocalypse has managed to incorporate weighty themes of outsiderdom in an uncharacteristically subtle manner."
15754,m/xanadu,Eric Henderson,Fresh,2008-06-25,"While the movie is every bit as garish and overly shellacked as the other bomb musicals of its era, at least this one looks like irresponsible amounts of money were thrown around."
15755,m/xanadu,Larry Vitacco,Fresh,2020-05-27,Xanadu offers a wealth of special effects entrancingly strung out along a rather impoverished screenplay.
15756,m/xanadu,William Thomas,Rotten,2019-04-01,This modern musical with tunes written by Where Are They Now pop band ELO falls flat on its face simply because the premise is so utterly ludicrous.
15757,m/xanadu,People Staff,Rotten,2019-04-01,"Olivia Newton-John's encore-after Grease-is an awkward musical fantasy that dooms the Australian songbird to play a muse, one of Zeus' nine daughters."

15759,m/xanadu,James Berardinelli,Fresh,2008-06-10,"Conventional wisdom decrees that Xanadu is a horrible film. In a sense, conventional wisdom may be correct, but it ignores one key ingredient: viewed in the right frame of mind, this movie can be a lot of fun."

15769,m/xanadu,Raquel Stecher,Rotten,2019-08-11,Xanadu is total confection. It's 100% ridiculous. Very little of it makes sense.... They really should have nixed the idea of finding a Gibb look-a-like and went with a song-and-dance man instead.
15770,m/xanadu,Brian Orndorf,Fresh,2008-06-29,"Look at Xanadu with an eye toward storytelling superiority and your head will explode. To appreciate the madness within, one must take in the blinding neon sights with an open heart and at least one nostril-coating line of cocaine."
15771,m/xanadu,Lawrence O'Toole,Rotten,2019-03-27,What could have possessed the people involved in Xanadu to go ahead with this utter nonsense?

15776,m/xxy,Emanuel Levy,Fresh,2008-06-27,"To the director's credit, what could have been a clinical study or fact-based medical case instead unfolds as a touching coming of age tale focusing on the tender romantic angle."
15777,m/xxy,Enrique Buchichio,Rotten,2007-10-09,"Un drama intimista y sutil, alejado de cualquier explotacin morbosa, sobre un tema poco transitado por el cine. Falla un poco en conviccin dramtica, pero algunas actuaciones elevan el inters."

15779,m/xxy,David Wiegand,Fresh,2008-08-01,Luca Puenzo's XXY is as finely crafted as a great work of literature.
15780,m/xxy,Nick Schager,Fresh,2008-03-25,"There's a secret at the heart of XXY, but the real mystery is why writer-director Luca Puenzo insists on unnecessary symbolic gestures for a story otherwise told with delicacy, restraint, and maturity."
15781,m/xxy,Pablo Villaça,Rotten,2008-01-16,"Traz um final em aberto que, ao invs de enriquecer a narrativa ao honrar sua complexidade, soa mais como uma incapacidade do prprio filme em encontrar algo relevante a dizer."
15782,m/xxy,Dennis Schwartz,Fresh,2008-09-26,The good news is that this is an intelligent drama that is in no way exploitative.
15783,m/xxy,Marc Mohan,Fresh,2008-05-30,A tale that could have been handled with condescending simplicity becomes a testament to the flawed but noble humanity of both parents and children.
15784,m/xxy,Bilge Ebiri,Fresh,2008-03-24,The Argentine writer-director downplays the clinical angle and avoids easy melodramatic pitfalls.
15785,m/xxy,Jonathan Holland,Fresh,2007-05-20,"Pic has more in common with standard child/parent conflict dramas than it would probably care to admit, but its sensitive treatment of an equally sensitive theme elevates it into something memorable."
15786,m/xxy,Sara Michelle Fetters,Fresh,2008-09-26,"What might be the greatest thing about XXY, however, is that it absolutely refuses to judge. More, Puenzo never feels obliged to bow to the clichs of the genre, instead allowing her picture to ebb and flow like all of this was happening for real."
15787,m/xxy,Amber Wilkinson,Fresh,2007-08-24,"Ricardo Darin... again proves that he can break your heart with a look, conveying unspoken emotion with a glance that taps you into his pain."
15788,m/xxy,Wesley Morris,Fresh,2008-05-22,"What ensues between them, both psychologically and sexually, is one of the strangest, most fascinating dysfunctional relationships I've seen in a movie. The acting is outstanding."
15789,m/xxy,Maria-Christina Villaseñor,Fresh,2020-03-09,"Fluid camera work filled with shots of window frames, mirrors, and reflections emphasizes the story's doubling, narrowness of view, and constant thinking about fixed ideas and viewpoints."
15790,m/xxy,Bill White,Fresh,2008-09-26,"Despite its sometimes creepy tentativeness, XXY succeeds as a meditation on gender and sexuality, one that refuses an easy answer to the question, 'Is it a boy or a girl?'"
15791,m/xxy,Matthew Turner,Fresh,2008-05-08,"A beautifully made, superbly acted drama that packs a powerfully emotional punch and delivers a passionate message about acceptance."
15792,m/xxy,Nick Pinkerton,Rotten,2008-04-30,"It takes a controlling hand to chisel something more contoured than monotony out of this dense angst, and director Luca Puenzo doesn't have it."
15793,m/xxy,Gerald Peary,Fresh,2009-04-23,Puenzo goes beyond medical melodrama with a talented ensemble of Argentine actors who make this weird tale breathe.

15795,m/yankee_doodle_dandy,Bob Bloom,Fresh,2003-09-20,A timeless treasure that will never fade. Cagney is great; Huston unforgetable. A wonderful slice of Americana.

15797,m/yankee_doodle_dandy,Mike Massie,Rotten,2020-08-15,Primarily a splashy exhibition of Cohan's most popular stories and lyrics and music (upbeat yet jingoistic arrangements).
15798,m/yankee_doodle_dandy,Emanuel Levy,Fresh,2008-03-05,"A rousing, old-fashioned biopic of patriotic showman George M. Cohan, played with energy and gusto by Jimmy Cagney in his only Oscar-winning performance."
15799,m/yankee_doodle_dandy,Roger Ebert,Fresh,2000-01-01,The greatness of the film resides entirely in the Cagney performance.

15801,m/yankee_doodle_dandy,Mark Bourne,Fresh,2006-04-05,"It delivers its red-white-and-blue patriotism to you by the exuberant bushel, but this grand old film reminds us that there was a time when patriotism was more heartfelt than bullying and jingoistic."

15810,m/yankee_doodle_dandy,John J. Puccio,Fresh,2003-10-06,...Cagney's picture through and through. He imbues every scene with the kind of electricity only a handful of screen stars have ever managed.

15812,m/yankee_doodle_dandy,Tim Brayton,Fresh,2016-07-10,Maybe the best-case scenario for what happens when a film biopic does everything right.

15814,m/yonkers_joe,Nick Schager,Rotten,2009-01-05,"Yonkers Joe confirms that writer-director Robert Celestin knows his way around a local cash-stakes game of craps. It also proves, unfortunately, that his scripting skills need substantial honing."
15815,m/yonkers_joe,Brent Simon,Fresh,2009-01-28,"Palminteri helps the film earn very slight passing marks, if only mostly because it's interesting to see these old operators have to adapt their schemes for new times."
15816,m/yonkers_joe,Carol Cling,Fresh,2009-03-03,"It's far from a natural, but somehow, some way, it makes its point."
15817,m/yonkers_joe,Leo Goldsmith,Rotten,2009-08-08,"Mostly strong, that is, with the major exception of Tom Guiry's portrayal of Joe Jr. Painfully broad, Guiry practically sinks the film with garishly slack-jawed and over-the-top manchildishness."
15818,m/yonkers_joe,Gary Thompson,Fresh,2009-02-06,"Celestino's bid to wrap everything up in tidy fashion feels at odds with the grittiness of the film's first two-thirds, but in the end, the movie's glimpse into a seldom-seen slice of life sticks with you."
15819,m/yonkers_joe,Norm Schrager,Fresh,2009-01-08,"If you can watch Yonkers Joe without thinking it's a mild Rain Man rip-off, you'll enjoy a film that could have been plagued with plot issues, but rises above it"
15820,m/yonkers_joe,John P. McCarthy,Rotten,2008-12-10,"While Celestino doesn't roll snake eyes exactly, Yonkers Joe could have prospered if the filmmaker had worried more about keeping the dice hot and had let viewers' hearts warm naturally."
15821,m/yonkers_joe,Reyhan Harmanci,Rotten,2009-01-16,"Yonkers Joe is incoherent, succeeding neither as an exciting gambling ride nor a touching family story."
15822,m/yonkers_joe,Lisa Kennedy,Fresh,2009-01-16,"As Janice, Christine Lahti is the pivot between father and son. The scenes between Janice and Joe Jr. are sweet, harrowing, movie-altering."
15823,m/yonkers_joe,Stephen Holden,Rotten,2009-01-09,"For all its attention to detail, Yonkers Joe isn't half as tough as it pretends to be. The real story of these bottom-feeders and the sad young man they exploit is a lot uglier than the movie even begins to let on."
15824,m/yonkers_joe,Ron Wilkinson,Fresh,2008-06-23,"A sweet and tidy neo-noir underworld thriller with a heart, thanks to excellent performances by the lead trio and a great setting in the seedy underworld of gambling con-artists."
15825,m/yonkers_joe,Brian Tallerico,Rotten,2009-01-13,"Yonkers Joe is like a so-so trip to Vegas, one where you lose as much as you gain gambling. In other words, it's not the trip you're most likely to tell your friends about."
15826,m/yonkers_joe,Stephen Whitty,Fresh,2009-01-09,"A nicely photographed, mostly satisfying look at a gang of East Coast sharps and how they part marks from their money."
15827,m/yonkers_joe,Michelle Orange,Fresh,2009-01-07,"Lahti burns through a thinly written role with a surprising level of warmth and humanity, and Guiry is at times repellently convincing as a kid genetically incapable of either nuance or fakery."
15828,m/yonkers_joe,Noel Murray,Fresh,2009-01-09,"[Director] Celestino steers clear of the can't-miss pulp thriller that Yonkers Joe could've been, and goes for broke by giving it big dollop of schmaltz. His horse doesn't come in, but it runs a respectable race."
15829,m/yonkers_joe,Frank Lovece,Rotten,2009-01-09,"Heartfelt, well-acted but overly sincere drama of a smalltime hustler and the 20-year-old Down's syndrome son he's barely known."
15830,m/yonkers_joe,Stan Hall,Rotten,2009-01-23,"The parts of Yonkers Joe that have to do with gambling are fun; unfortunately, they make up only half the movie."

15836,m/you_will_be_my_son,Jim Schembri,Fresh,2012-11-02,"Leisurely paced at the outset, director Gilles Legrand builds a considerable head of emotional steam."
15837,m/you_will_be_my_son,Andrea Gronvall,Fresh,2013-07-25,"Great talent and a monstrous ego often come as a package deal, as illustrated by this insightful, taut 2011 drama set in Bordeaux."
15838,m/you_will_be_my_son,Eric Hynes,Fresh,2013-08-13,"Evoking a contemporary fable but unfolding like a thriller, You Will Be My Son is most of all a devastatingly realistic depiction of the festering resentments shared between a father and son."
15839,m/you_will_be_my_son,Siobhan Synnot,Fresh,2012-12-02,Perfect for Christmas in the sense that you'll look on your own family a little more warmly after this one.
15840,m/you_will_be_my_son,Boyd van Hoeij,Fresh,2012-03-22,"A classy, full-bodied family drama from Gallic scribe-helmer Gilles Legrand."
15841,m/you_will_be_my_son,Matthew Kassel,Fresh,2013-08-14,A kind of parable that is as much an effective portrait of intergenerational struggle as it is a slick psychological thriller with Shakespearian shadings.
15842,m/you_will_be_my_son,Andrew Schenker,Rotten,2013-08-11,"For all of the director's willingness to explore his characters' unexpected depths, he's still hamstrung by his perpetually tasteful cinema-of-quality aesthetic."
15843,m/you_will_be_my_son,Robbie Collin,Fresh,2012-12-06,"As metaphors for life go, wine has a very high yield, and Gilles Legrand's sensitive screenplay tramples out every last drop of juice."
15844,m/you_will_be_my_son,Peter Keough,Rotten,2013-09-19,Gilles Legrand's draggy melodrama about miserable characters who persist in their folly and never wise up is strictly vin ordinaire.
15845,m/you_will_be_my_son,Louise Keller,Fresh,2012-10-28,This is a potent story about fathers and sons and filmmaker Gilles Legrand builds beautifully and devastatingly on this theme
15846,m/you_will_be_my_son,David Parkinson,Fresh,2012-12-03,Lustrous photography and a fine cast make this dark drama a compelling one.
15847,m/you_will_be_my_son,Kenneth Turan,Fresh,2013-09-11,"A strongly acted, character-driven melodrama, concerned with the dynamics of family in general and father-son issues in particular, it presents situations so emotionally supercharged that the whole story could have come straight out of Balzac."
15848,m/you_will_be_my_son,Nicholas Bell,Fresh,2019-08-22,As elegantly made as the fine wines that fuel the narrative.

15856,m/your_highness,Vic Holtreman,Fresh,2011-04-07,"If for you a combination of a medieval setting, plenty of sex jokes, dirty language & topless women makes for a funny movie, then Your Highness is for you (that's not necessarily a criticism)."
15857,m/your_highness,Betsy Sharkey,Fresh,2011-04-07,"[Green] has an easy touch when it comes to comedy, which means you can almost sense those moments when the actors give themselves over to the silliness."

15864,m/your_highness,Nick Pinkerton,Rotten,2011-04-06,"The movie's improvisatory recklessness often relies on stock, fallback comedy: scenes lazily punchlined on four-letter words, pot slang, and gay jokes only offensive in their unoriginality."

15875,m/your_name_2017,Daniel Eagan,Fresh,2017-04-05,"Even at its most baffling, Your Name maintains a visual style that approaches the grandeur of anime masters like Hayao Miyazaki."

15878,m/your_name_2017,Mark Kermode,Fresh,2016-11-20,"Teen audiences in search of a ""relatable"" love story will find this every bit as accessible as Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, while older viewers will delight in the way that archaic arts have become an integral part of 21st-century cinema."
15879,m/your_name_2017,Kevin Harley,Fresh,2016-11-16,"For animation fanciers new to Shinkai, it could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship."

15881,m/your_name_2017,Sean P. Means,Fresh,2017-04-06,"Shinkai creates a gorgeous, richly detailed look at two sides of Japan... Shinkai's gift for melding these two Japans into a single, luminous story is what gives Your Name its exquisite tension."
15882,m/your_name_2017,Justin Chang,Fresh,2017-04-06,"The movie's spirit is by turns energetic and serene, impetuous and wise, its wild shifts from comedy to tragedy to romance revealing themselves not as tonal swings so much as variations in a larger cosmic pattern."
15883,m/your_name_2017,Edmund Lee,Fresh,2016-11-09,One of the most poignant responses to a natural catastrophe that Japanese cinema has offered in the wake of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

15887,m/your_name_2017,Anita Katz,Fresh,2017-04-07,"You may have to fortify your illogicality tolerance when viewing the anime adventure ""Your Name."" But this body-swap romance by the exciting and talented filmmaker Makoto Shinkai is nonetheless exquisite, beautiful and entertaining."
15888,m/your_name_2017,Ella Taylor,Fresh,2017-04-06,Your Name is a stirring tale of rescue with a boisterous edge of YA mischief. It's also a love story with a swoony romantic affinity for the age-old tussle between chance and fate.
15889,m/your_name_2017,David Sims,Fresh,2017-04-07,"With its balance of grounded emotion and wondrous escapism, Your Name should firmly establish Shinkai as an auteur to follow for many years to come."
15890,m/your_name_2017,Matthew Bond,Rotten,2017-10-18,"The vital second half feels ponderous and over-blown, and the eventual explanation too complex for its own good."
15891,m/your_name_2017,Katie Smith-Wong,Fresh,2019-11-13,"While Your Name's story is dubious, it doesn't disappoint. One of the standout features from London Film Festival, and one of the best animated features this year."

15895,m/youve_got_mail,James Sanford,Fresh,2000-01-01,"If you thought Hanks and Ryan were endearing in their previous teamings in 'Sleepless In Seattle' and 'Joe Versus the Volcano,' you ain't seen nothing yet."
15896,m/youve_got_mail,David Keyes,Fresh,2000-01-01,"There's no serious problem that would keep me from recommending the movie, but if you want a more organized, more serious, more humorous and more organic film, watch the similar Sleepless In Seattle."
15897,m/youve_got_mail,Roger Ebert,Fresh,2000-01-01,Ryan and Hanks have more winning smiles than most people have expressions!
15898,m/youve_got_mail,Karina Montgomery,Fresh,2001-06-14,"You've Got Mail is a relentlessly practical movie, big business versus little business, strangers touching over the internet versus real life volatility."
15899,m/youve_got_mail,Cynthia Fuchs,Rotten,2000-01-01,"Seasonal to the max, You've Got Mail is a paradigm of product placement, packaged good cheer and innocuous irony."
15900,m/youve_got_mail,Bob Bloom,Fresh,2000-01-01,"You've Got Mail is a timely romance for this impersonal, computer-driven decade."
15901,m/youve_got_mail,Susan Granger,Fresh,2000-01-01,"What a sparkling, sweet treat! It's the most romantic movie of the holiday season."
15902,m/youve_got_mail,Jim Judy,Fresh,2000-01-01,Crisp plot and smart and funny dialogue.

15907,m/youve_got_mail,Lawrence Toppman,Rotten,2000-01-01,"Another problem is chemistry; remarkably, Hanks and Ryan haven't any until the last few scenes."
15908,m/youve_got_mail,James Berardinelli,Fresh,2000-01-01,It's a feel-good movie that offers enough comedy and romance to warm the heart without risking a sentimental overdose.
15909,m/youve_got_mail,Maitland McDonagh,Rotten,2000-01-01,"That Joe is smug, oily and a ruthless destroyer of small businesses, while Kathleen intolerably twee, makes for some rough sledding that the combined star power of Ryan and Hanks doesn't ameliorate."
15910,m/youve_got_mail,Peter Keough,Rotten,2002-03-24,"Structural elegance is not the hallmark of Mail; neither is depth of insight into the nature of role playing, love, and identity."
15911,m/youve_got_mail,Rachel Wagner,Fresh,2019-02-28,It is chock full of Nora Ephron's perfect writing.

15913,m/youve_got_mail,Shawn Levy,Rotten,2000-01-01,"It's handsome, professional moviemaking all around, just a little flat when it ought to soar."
15914,m/yves_saint_laurent_lamour_fou,Derek Malcolm,Fresh,2011-11-11,"It goes through all the usual celebratory motions but, without giving away too many secrets, suggests that nothing satisfied him enough - in fact, quite a lot made him suicidal."
15915,m/yves_saint_laurent_lamour_fou,Matthew Sorrento,Rotten,2011-05-27,"[F]ans of fashion will delight over the subject, especially those who love the gay-outsider-who-makes-it theme. In The Devil Wears Prada, it took Stanley Tucci one scene to nail it, while this film's still searching at 103 minutes."
15916,m/yves_saint_laurent_lamour_fou,Lisa Schwarzbaum,Fresh,2011-05-11,"Satisfying in its insight into the relationship between creativity, temperament, and (no small consideration) wealth."
15917,m/yves_saint_laurent_lamour_fou,Betsy Sharkey,Fresh,2011-05-20,"Not the first documentarian to examine Saint Laurent's life, this affectionate and frustrating film is essentially a deconstruction of the aesthetic life of this true visionary as defined by the art he collected."
15918,m/yves_saint_laurent_lamour_fou,Sarah Boslaugh,Rotten,2011-05-27,"Berg's memories of Saint Laurent are distant and sanitized, which is reasonable given that he is recalling a deceased friend and lover, but they don't make for the most exciting cinema."
15919,m/yves_saint_laurent_lamour_fou,Mick LaSalle,Fresh,2011-05-19,"Saint Laurent, in archival footage, comes across as an engaging fellow, deeply shy and sensitive, often smiling but without much of a gift for happiness - someone who started out beautiful but whose pain eventually showed up on his face."
15920,m/yves_saint_laurent_lamour_fou,Chris Barsanti,Fresh,2011-04-28,"...a study in mortality, sadness, and the transience of beauty."
15921,m/yves_saint_laurent_lamour_fou,Philip French,Fresh,2011-11-13,"It's a fairly circumspect affair, though Berg talks frankly of his partner's alcoholism, drug-taking and terrible bouts of depression."
15922,m/yves_saint_laurent_lamour_fou,Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat,Rotten,2011-05-04,A flat and uninvolving documentary about Yves Saint Laurent.
15923,m/yves_saint_laurent_lamour_fou,Corey Hall,Fresh,2011-05-26,"L'Amour Fou is somehow intimate without being terribly revealing. It suffers from an overdose of elegance, and a desire to preserve a bit of the great man's dignity, ...but, like his work, it's only a beautiful drapery."
15924,m/yves_saint_laurent_lamour_fou,Molly Eichel,Rotten,2011-05-27,"""L'Amour Fou"" sometimes trudges along with little insight into the genius of Saint Laurent."
15925,m/yves_saint_laurent_lamour_fou,Jennifer Merin,Fresh,2011-05-08,"A biographical documentary tribute to Yves Saint-Laurent and his accomplishments. But, told primarily from the perspective of Saint-Laurent's grieving partner, it's sadder than it is celebratory."
15926,m/yves_saint_laurent_lamour_fou,Joe Williams,Rotten,2011-05-27,"""L'Amour Fou"" is an elegant fabric without the rough texture of real life and love."
15927,m/yves_saint_laurent_lamour_fou,Brandon Judell,Fresh,2011-04-14,"A true must-see if you adore fashion, interior design, the Sixties and Seventies, travel, and an exploration of depressed genius with guest appearances by Andy Warhol and Mick Jagger."
15928,m/yves_saint_laurent_lamour_fou,Carrie Rickey,Rotten,2011-05-26,"To suggest, as this oblique film does, that you are what you collect is like looking at Picasso's art collection without correlating it to his own works."
15929,m/yves_saint_laurent_lamour_fou,Keith Uhlich,Fresh,2011-05-10,Perched somewhere between a sanded-edged official portrait and a keen examination of affluence run amok.
15930,m/yves_saint_laurent_lamour_fou,Amie Simon,Fresh,2019-03-06,"Appearances by Andy Warhol and Mick Jagger punctuate this lovingly-told life story, but it's really the love and admiration of Bergé that says the most about this fascinating man."
15931,m/yves_saint_laurent_lamour_fou,Nina Garin,Rotten,2011-06-02,Those looking for YSL drama and passion are more likely to find it in a department store rather than in a movie theater.
15932,m/yves_saint_laurent_lamour_fou,Chris Hewitt,Rotten,2011-06-10,"Having opened with the promise of something raw and intimate, ""L'Amour Fou"" ends with a feeling that everything was orchestrated to prevent revealing anything."
15933,m/yves_saint_laurent_lamour_fou,Peter Keough,Rotten,2011-05-26,"""I don't have a soul,"" Berg laments as a Brancusi sculpture is packed away. ""These objects don't have a soul."" Neither does this movie."
15934,m/zombies_of_mass_destruction,Edward Havens,Fresh,2009-07-22,Has the potential to become a minor hit on the midnight film circuit with the help of a mid-level indie distributor.
15935,m/zombies_of_mass_destruction,Scott Weinberg,Fresh,2010-04-06,"Certainly not on the scale of a Romero, but at least these filmmakers paid some attention in zombie class."
15936,m/zombies_of_mass_destruction,Steve Biodrowski,Rotten,2010-04-13,"Zombies of Mass Destruction attempts to use its familiar genre elements in the service of a post-9/11 political satire...unfortunately, the jokes fall flat, and the horror never hits a nerve."
15937,m/zombies_of_mass_destruction,Peter Keough,Rotten,2010-05-05,"Kevin Hamedani's muddy, heavy-handed parody of War on Terror paranoia doesn't vary much from genre formula, but it does serve up political correctness with refreshingly bad taste."
15938,m/zombies_of_mass_destruction,Amie Simon,Fresh,2019-03-12,"Once the extreme gore hits, the buckets of corn syrupy splatter and one liners don't stop (fans of Evil Dead and Dead Alive will be very, very happy)."
15939,m/zoolander_2,Michael Heaton,Fresh,2016-02-18,"There is so much stupid fun in Zoolander 2, the movie practically dares you not to laugh. Don't take that bet. But don't miss the movie."
15940,m/zoolander_2,Roe McDermott,Rotten,2016-03-11,A thorough disappointment.
15941,m/zoolander_2,Jim Lane,Rotten,2016-02-25,"The story is beside the point in this pointless movie; it's less tasteless and offensive than the original, but just as god-awful."
15942,m/zoolander_2,Scott Tobias,Rotten,2016-02-11,"Zoolander 2 seems like the result of a 15-year game of ""exquisite corpse,"" the surrealist exercise where different writers add to a story independent of each other, strand by strand, without full knowledge of previous contributions."
15943,m/zoolander_2,Debbie Lynn Elias,Rotten,2019-11-05,"Directed by [Ben] Stiller, the work is serviceable but not outstanding, save for the film serving as a compact travelogue for Rome."
15944,m/zoolander_2,Joanna Langfield,Fresh,2016-02-10,"Yes, it's ridiculous. It's supposed to be."
15945,m/zoolander_2,Allen Adams,Rotten,2019-02-20,Derek Zoolander and company have definitely fallen out of fashion.
15946,m/zoolander_2,Israel Acosta Aroche,Rotten,2016-03-01,It's unbelievable that Ben Stiller decided to end his good directing streak with this poor excuse of a joke. [Full review in Spanish]
15947,m/zoolander_2,Peter Canavese,Rotten,2016-02-17,A goofy gag machine that will raise smiles for some and make others just plain gag.
15948,m/zoolander_2,Matthew Turner,Rotten,2016-02-11,"Disappoints in all the ways you expect it to, coasting by on catchphrases and cameos and not much else."
15949,m/zoolander_2,Tim Grierson,Rotten,2016-02-09,"The stakes are higher, the action is bigger, the ambitions are grander, the jokes are appreciably less funny. Like many comedy sequels, ""Zoolander 2"" supersizes everything so that it's that much more apparent how few of the jokes are connecting."
15950,m/zoolander_2,Francesca Steele,Rotten,2016-02-11,"In its sequel, the jokes, if you can call them that, are trying way too hard."
15951,m/zoolander_2,Donald Strohman,Rotten,2016-02-12,"...instead of capturing the heart and charm of the original, this absolutely unnecessary sequel just comes off as a giant mess that should have never made it off the writer's table."
15952,m/zoolander_2,Lara de Matos,Rotten,2016-03-11,"To even attempt an explanation of the over-arching narrative would be rather pointless -- mainly because, there isn't one."
15953,m/zoolander_2,Alex Zane,Fresh,2016-02-11,"It's a hit and miss hour-and-a-half that lacks the charm of the first movie, but Zoolander 2 raises just enough chuckles to justify Derek's return to the big screen."
15954,m/zoolander_2,Richard Roeper,Rotten,2016-02-11,Some people find Derek Zoolander funny and likable and endearingly dumb. I don't. I find him grating.
15955,m/zoolander_2,David Kaplan,Rotten,2016-02-11,"Silly and stupid, but reasonably entertaining if you just sit back and accept it for what it is."
15956,m/zoolander_2,Frank Wilkins,Rotten,2016-02-12,The warmed over humor is a tired one-trick pony that spit the bit barely 15 minutes into the original.
15957,m/zoolander_2,Jim Judy,Rotten,2016-02-12,"Painful to watch in how many jokes and gags land with a thud (like a bad ""SNL"" skit that goes on and on). (Full Content Review for Parents - Sex, Violence, Profanity, etc. - Also Available)"
15958,m/zoolander_2,Roger Moore,Rotten,2016-02-10,Funnier than any terrible movie has any right to be.
